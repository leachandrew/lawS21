</span></span> to <strong>upload on Blackboard</strong> under Assignments. You may handwrite answers if you will be able to scan/photograph &amp; convert them <strong>to a single PDF</strong>, if they are easily readable, but this is <em>not preferred</em>. See my <a href="/resources/#how-to-make-a-pdf-for-submitting-assignments">guide to making a PDF</a> - an essential skill in the modern world. If you are handwriting answers, you may print the <code>pdf</code> above and write on it, or just write on a piece of paper (we only need your answers).</p>
<p>For the few questions that ask you to draw a <strong>graph</strong>, <em>try</em> to do so <em>on your computer</em> (use MS Paint, the drawing tools in MS Word or MS Powerpoint, plot points in MS Excel, drawing/notetaking apps, etc.), and save it as an image to include on your homework document. Again, they need not be perfect or to scale, just show that you understand the broad idea. Being able to understand and sketch the graphs is still a very important and useful skill! If all else fails, I will be lenient in grading graph questions if you are unable to technologically include a graph.</p>
<p>You may work together (and I highly encourage that) but you must turn in your own answers. Your TA, under my supervision, will grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, and one question will be graded for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately.</p>

<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>
<p>Explain some differences between the Common Law tradition and the Civil Law tradition. How is this distinction <em>different</em> from the differences between Civil law and Criminal law?</p>

<h3 id="question-5-the-elgin-marbles">Question 5 — The Elgin Marbles</h3>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin_Marbles">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Parthenon Marbles, also known as the Elgin Marbles are a collection of Classical Greek marble sculptures made under the supervision of the architect and sculptor Phidias and his assistants. They were originally part of the temple of the Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis of Athens. The collection is now on display in the British Museum, in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From 1801 to 1812, agents of Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin removed about half of the surviving sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from the Propylaea and Erechtheum. The Marbles were transported by sea to Britain. Elgin later claimed to have obtained in 1801 an official decree (a firman) from the Sublime Porte, the central government of the Ottoman Empire which at that time ruled Greece. This firman has not been found in the Ottoman archives despite its wealth of documents from the same period and its veracity is disputed. The Acropolis Museum displays a portion of the complete frieze, aligned in orientation and within sight of the Parthenon, with the position of the missing elements clearly marked and space left should they be returned to Athens.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Britain, the acquisition of the collection was supported by some, while some others, such as Lord Byron, likened the Earl’s actions to vandalism or looting. Following a public debate in Parliament and its subsequent exoneration of Elgin, he sold the Marbles to the British government in 1816. They were then passed into the trusteeship of the British Museum,where they are now on display in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After gaining its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, the newly-founded Greek state began a series of projects to restore its monuments and retrieve looted art. It has expressed its disapproval of Elgin’s removal of the Marbles from the Acropolis and the Parthenon, which is regarded as one of the world’s greatest cultural monuments. International efforts to repatriate the Marbles to Greece were intensified in the 1980s by then Greek Minister of Culture Melina Mercouri, and there are now many organisations actively campaigning for the Marbles’ return, several united as part of the International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures. The Greek government itself continues to urge the return of the marbles to Athens so as to be unified with the remaining marbles and for the complete Parthenon frieze sequence to be restored, through diplomatic, political and legal means.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A range of slightly different points have been put by British Museum spokespersons over the years in defence of retention of the Elgin Marbles within the museum. The main points include:
- the maintenance of a single worldwide-oriented cultural collection, all viewable in one location, thereby serving as a world heritage centre;
- the saving of the marbles from what would have been, or would be, pollution and other damage if relocated back to Athens; and
- a legal position that the museum is banned by charter from returning any part of its collection.</p>

<li><p>Would you expect the transaction costs of private bargaining to be high or low in this case? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the difference between the Normative Coase and Normative Hobbes approaches to property law. Given your answer to (a), which seems more appropriate in this case?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose it were decided that Greece had a right (in the words of Calabresi and Melamed, an entitlement) to the statues. Given your answer to (a), what would you expect to be the final outcome if this entitlement were protected by each of the following remedies: injunctive relief (property rules)? damages (liability rules)? inalienability?</p></li>

<h3 id="question-6-water-rights">Question 6 — Water Rights</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Centuries ago in England, the general rule [on water rights] was that rights were vested in the “riparian owner,” that is, in the person who owned the land on the bank of the river. The riparian owner’s principal right was to a flow of water past his land. It would be a violation of someone else’s rights for an upstream user to use the water that passed by his property in such a way as to reduce the flow to downstream users. The upstream user could not, therefore, divert so much of the water to his own use that the flow was significantly diminished for those downstream. A riparian was restricted in his ability to sell water to nonriparians (i.e., people who do not own land along the water).</p>
<p>However, in the 19th century, this legal arrangement had to be altered because industrial demand on the natural flow of a river frequently exceeded the supply. In the eastern United States, these issues were resolved by elaborating the natural-flow theory of water rights that had been adopted from the English common law. An alternative theory of water rights appeared in the western United States. Under the reasonable-use theory, the riparian owner is entitled to use the water flow in any reasonable way. It was deemed reasonable for one owner to use all of the water in a stream or lake when others are making no use of it. Under the reasonable-use theory, a riparian owner does not have a right to the natural water flow. Furthermore, a riparian owner may transfer rights to nonriparians.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Explain why a rule which worked perfectly well in pre-industrial England might not have worked well after the industrial revolution. Hint: consider the argument in Demsetz (1967).</p></li>
<li><p>The Coase theorem would suggest that, when transaction costs are low, the initial allocation of property rights does not affect efficiency. Is that the only difference between the natural-flow and reasonable-use theories? Does the law seem to be evolving in the direction of greater efficiency?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="shipwrecks">Shipwrecks</h3>
<p>Under the ancient law of admiralty, the finder of an abandoned shipwreck becomes the owner under the <em>law of finds</em>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Discuss the incentives (good and bad) this rule creates for would-be treasure hunters.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose instead, the law followed a “first-committed searcher doctrine” where the first hunter to invest resources, regardless of whether they were the party to find the shipwreck, was awarded ownership.</p></li>
<li><p>The Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987 is a federal law that upended this doctrine by awarding ownership of the discovered ship to the U.S. State whose waters the ship is found in (rather than to the discoverer).</p></li>
