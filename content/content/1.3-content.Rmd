# <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

Today we essentially review the basic tools of microeconomics with a focus on economic efficiency — its definitions, why markets and consensual exchange are efficient, as well as what can give rise to inefficiencies. This will help us next class when we discuss whether the law *should* be efficient.

# <i class="fas fa-book-reader fa-lg"></i> Readings

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Ch. 2 in Cooter and Ulen, 2012, *Law & Economics*
- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Ch. 2 in Friedman, 2000, *Law's Order*
- [<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> SMBC: Super Efficient](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/super-efficient)

The textbook covers a full review of intermediate microeconomics — utility maximization, supply and demand, perfect competition, monopoly, game theory, choice under risk, informational problems — in Chapter 2. It's unlikely we'll need *all* of it (now), but it will be helpful to refer back to.

Friedman, as usual, provides a great discussion of efficiency (he prefers a “Marshallian” view of efficiency as opposed to Pareto or Kaldor-Hicks) and also launches into a discussion about whether law *should* be efficient, which will be more relevant next class.
