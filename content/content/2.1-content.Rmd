# <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

We begin with a brief (re)introduction to static game theory to prepare to first look at property law.

Since Hood College [has designated](https://www.hood.edu/offices-services/registrars-office/academic-calendar) that there are no classes on Thursday February 18, we will not meet again until next Tuesday. This makes it difficult to get too deep into property and the Coase theorem today, and so I will save it all for next week. Please look at the **required readings** for next week on the associated class pages, and next week we will also start our **required discussion board**, since we will have readings.
