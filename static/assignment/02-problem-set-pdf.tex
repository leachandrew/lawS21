\title{Homework 2}
\author{ECON 315 Spring 2021}
\date{Due by 11:59 PM Tuesday, April 13, 2021 by PDF upload in
Blackboard Assignments}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

Please \textbf{type} your answers to the following questions in a
document and \textbf{save as a PDF}\footnote{In MS Word, or Pages, or
  most word processing software, File -\textgreater{} Save As
  -\textgreater{} PDF, or File -\textgreater{} Export -\textgreater{}
  PDF.} to \textbf{upload on Blackboard} under Assignments. You may
handwrite answers if you will be able to scan/photograph \& convert them
\textbf{to a single PDF}, if they are easily readable, but this is
\emph{not preferred}. See my
\href{/resources/\#how-to-make-a-pdf-for-submitting-assignments}{guide
to making a PDF} - an essential skill in the modern world. If you are
handwriting answers, you may print the \texttt{pdf} above and write on
it, or just write on a piece of paper (we only need your answers).

For any questions that ask you to draw a \textbf{graph}, \emph{try} to
do so \emph{on your computer} (use MS Paint, the drawing tools in MS
Word or MS Powerpoint, plot points in MS Excel, drawing/notetaking apps,
etc.), and save it as an image to include on your homework document.
Again, they need not be perfect or to scale, just show that you
understand the broad idea. Being able to understand and sketch the
graphs is still a very important and useful skill! If all else fails, I
will be lenient in grading graph questions if you are unable to
technologically include a graph.

You may work together (and I highly encourage that) but you must turn in
your own answers. I will grade homeworks 70\% for completion, and for
the remaining 30\%, and one question will be graded for accuracy - so it
is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to
complete it accurately.

Thinking}\label{concepts-and-critical-thinking}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Explain the ``bargain theory'' of contracts, and what types of
  contracts courts will enforce or not enforce, under this approach.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{3in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  List, and explain at least five ways that contract law (at least
  ideally), promotes efficient behavior.
\end{enumerate}

\clearpage

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Explain the purpose of default rules. Why might parties leave gaps in
  their contract? What types of default rules promote efficiency? Also
  explain the idea of penalty defaults.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{3in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}

\item
  Explain several legal doctrines that courts use to invalidate
  contracts. What are the economic rationales behind each of these
  doctrines?
\end{enumerate}

\clearpage

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}

  Explain the difference between the following remedies:

    expectation damages

  \item
    and specific performance.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

What is the court's goal (in terms of compensating the Plaintiff) with
each amount of damages? How is specific performance similar to an
injunction in property law?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  Suppose I run a retail shop that hires extra cashiers during the
  holiday rush. Each year, we typically sign 6-week contracts with
  short-term employees, where we train them for 2 weeks before
  Thanksgiving and then employ them as cashiers for all of December at a
  pre-agreed wage.
\end{enumerate}

Suppose you agree to such a contract. Consider the following scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The day after Thanksgiving, I have already invested time and money
    in training you, and do not have time to train a replacement. You
    suddenly realize you are in a strong bargaining position and
    threaten to quit unless I raise your salary. With little choice, I
    rewrite the contract to pay you more.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Watching you interact with customers and other employees during
    training, I realize you are better suited to be a store
    \emph{manager} than a cashier. There is more work involved and you
    would not agree to do it for the same wage -- but your additional
    value to me as a manager is much greater than the additional cost
    (effort) to you. We rewrite the contract to make you a manager and
    pay you more.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Give an economic argument why the renegotiated contract should be
  enforced in the second scenario, while the original contract should be
  enforced in the first.
\item
  Would either renegotiated contract be enforced under the Bargain
  Theory of contracts?
\end{enumerate}

\item
  Amy inherits an 1963 Aston Martin DB5 from her eccentric rich uncle.
  Having little interest in antique cars, she agrees to sell it to Ben
  for \$30,000, who would have paid up to \$40,000 for it.
\end{enumerate}

A day before Amy and Ben meet to exchange a check and the keys, Cary
hears about Amy trying to sell her car, and offers Amy \$50,000 for it.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Who is the efficient owner of the car?
\item
  Suppose Amy decides to break her promise to Ben, and sell the car
  instead to Cary. Ben sues Amy for breach of contract. How much would
  \emph{expectation damages} be? Under expectation damages, who will end
  up owning the car?
\item
  Not wanting his new car to get snowed on, Ben pays a nonrefundable
  \$1,000 fee to rent an indoor parking space near his home. Both
  parties live in Denver, where both know it is likely to snow often.
  With the car and the parking space, Ben expects to get a benefit of
  \$40,000. If Ben wins \emph{reliance damages} in his lawsuit, how much
  will this be?
\item
  Suppose instead, the contract is protected by \emph{specific
  performance}. Cary doesn't like Ben and will not buy the car from him,
  and Amy and Ben are unable to renegotiate their contract. Who will end
  up with the car? What will Amy and Ben's payoffs be?
\item
  Under specific performance, what would be the gains from cooperation
  if Amy and Ben agreed to void their original contract so that Amy
  could sell the car to Cary? What would be each party's BATNA? If the
  gains were split evenly, how much would Amy have to pay Ben to buy her
  way out of their contract?
\item
  Which remedy, specific performance or expectation or damages, results
  in more efficient outcomes when transaction costs (to renegotiate the
  contract) are low? What about when transaction costs are high?
\end{enumerate}

\item
  Suppose a buyer contracts with a construction company to build a new
  building. The buyer values the building at \$100,000 and will pay the
  company \$75,000. Expecting a new building, the buyer had already
  purchased \$5,000 worth of nonrefundable custom art to decorate the
  building.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Calculate the amount of expectation damages for this case.
\item
  Suppose the construction company's costs, \(C\), are uncertain at the
  time the contract is signed. Over what range of \(C\) would it
  socially \emph{efficient} for the company to breach?
\item
  Over what range of \(C\) will the company \emph{actually} breach if
  the contract were protected by:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    no damages

  \item
    expectation damages
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Suppose the costs turn out to be \$125,000. Under expectation damages,
  will the company perform or breach?
\item
  With the \$125,000 costs, suppose the contract is protected by
  specific performance. If transaction costs are low, and the parties
  can (re)negotiate, what will happen? Assume that if a bargain occurs,
  any surplus is split evenly.
