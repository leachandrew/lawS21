&gt; “The statement that we should choose just rules, while emotionally satisfying, does not convey much information. Economic value may capture only part of what we want out of a legal system, but at least economic theory tells us how to get it. And consequences are an important part of what we want. The doctrine *fiat justicia, ruat coelum* (let justice be done though the skies fall) is, in my experience, uniformly proclaimed by people who are confident that doing justice will not, in fact, bring down the sky,” (p.22).

&gt; “As we develop the economic analysis of law, we will observe a surprising correspondence between justice and efficiency. In many cases principles we think of as just correspond fairly to rules that we discover are efficient...This suggests a radical conjecture—that what we call principles of justice may actually be rules of thumb for producing an efficient outcome, rules we have somehow internalized. Whether that is a sufficient account of justice you will have to decide for yourself,” (p.22-23).

&gt; “I think economists are right to emphasize efficiency, and I think so for (at least) two reasons. First, emphasizing efficiency forces us to concentrate on the most important problems... 

&gt; “In fact, whenever a policy is inefficient, there’s always an alternative policy that, in principle, is better for everyone. That’s what inefficiency means...

&gt; “So maybe we don’t want to pursue this alternative policy after all. But, says the economist, we ought at least to consider it...

&gt; “And — here’s the point — the bigger the deadweight loss, the greater the potential gains from an alternative policy. Therefore, the bigger the deadweight loss, the more it’s worth at least attempting to devise a good alternative policy. We calculate the deadweight loss as a rough but useful guide to how much effort we should put into this problem. (Calculating deadweight losses is the same thing as worrying about efficiency.)”

&gt; Politician: Here’s my program to make the health care system work better by subsidizing health care for the poor.

&gt; Economist: Your program costs a billion dollars and delivers half a billion dollars worth of benefits. That’s inefficient.

&gt; Politician: So what?

&gt; Economist: Well, the “so what” is that maybe you could take that billion dollars and deliver a full billion dollars worth of benefits instead if you spent it a little differently. Why not just hand the cash out to poor people?

&gt; Politician: Because I don’t want to help all poor people. I only want to help sick poor people — and this is the only way I can think of to do that.

&gt; Economist: Ah. So your goal here is not to make the health care system work better after all. Instead it’s to transfer resources to sick poor people.

&gt; Politician: I guess so.

&gt; Economist: That’s fine. Now we can have a healthy debate about whether that’s what we want to do.

“And now, you see, thanks to the economist’s insistence on thinking about efficiency, we end up having an honest debate about the politician’s real goal instead of a dishonest debate about the politician’s feigned goal. However the debate turns out, that’s a useful exercise.”

# Law Is a Bad Way To Redistribute Wealth

- Cooter &amp; Ulen have 4 good reasons why using tax policy is superior for redistribution

1. Taxes can target “rich” and “poor” more precisely than the legal system can

2. Distributional effects of legal changes are hard to predict

3. Transaction costs are higher for using the legal system (“Lawyers are more expensive than accountants”)

4. Broad-based taxes cause less distortion than narrowly-targeted laws/policies (or equivalent taxes)
