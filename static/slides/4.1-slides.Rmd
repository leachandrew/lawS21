.pull-left[
.smaller[
- .hi[Efficiency]
  - maximize total surplus to all individuals
  - scarce resources owned by whoever **values them the most**
  - make changes if social benefit $>$ social cost

- Design legal system that obtains .hi-purple[efficient outcomes]
  - Once the rules are set, people only act in own self-interest, without regard for efficiency
  - So the goal is to .hi-purple[set up the rules so that people acting in their interest will naturally lead to efficient outcomes]

# Recap of Our Approach So Far

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[Coase]'s insights give us a way to accomplish this:

> If .hi-purple[transaction costs are low], with .hi-purple[well-defined] and .hi-purple[tradeable property rights], parties can bargain voluntarily to reach the efficient outcome. 

- So the initial allocation of rights doesn't matter for efficiency

- **But** if transaction costs are high, we may not get the efficient outcome

# Recap of Our Approach So Far

.pull-left[

- Led us to two .hi-purple[normative] guidelines for designing an efficient legal system:
  1. Minimize transaction costs to facilitate exchange
  2. Allocate rights as efficiently as possible

- Tradeoff between .hi-purple[injunctive relief] and .hi-purple[damages]

# Recap of Our Approach So Far

- Law of .hi[property] works well for **spot** transactions

- Law of .hi[contracts] allow for more complicated **non-simultaneous** trade
  - enables cooperation and credible promises
  - encourages efficient disclosure of information

  - Parties reach an agreement *in advance* of transaction (though circumstances might change after the agreement)

- Up next: .hi-turquoise[“involuntary exchange”]
  - Parties who did *not* have an agreement before their (unfortunate) interaction
  - .hi-green[Example]: you are bicycling to class, I am texting while driving, and I hit you...

# An Example

- .hi-green[Example]: I am distracted and hit you with my car while you are bicycling to class
  - I did not *want* or *intend* to hit you

- Put aside questions of justice and retribution...and simply consider incentives

- Distracted driving (and hitting people) clearly imposes a serious negative externality on others

- Without any laws, we expect more than the efficient amount of distracted driving

- Society needs to design law to discourage this behavior
  - How do we do this?

# An Example

- Harder with tort law, because I did not intend to hit you (and we had no prior agreement)

- I made a choice ahead of time (to be distracted) that increased the likelihood of an accident

- So how do we create an incentive to avoid this type of outcome?

- Can imagine several ways

# An Example

.center[
![:scale 75%](../images/tortcause.png)
]

--

1. Punish the **choice** (criminal law, regulations): make it *illegal* to drive distracted (even if you don't hit anyone)

--

2. Punish the **outcome** (.hi[“Strict liability”]): if you hit someone, *regardless* of the choice you made, (distracted or not), you are liable

--

3. Punish the **combination** of choice & outcome (“.hi[“Negligence”]): if you hit someone, and you made a bad choice increasing the probability of an accident, you are liable

# Tort Law

# Tort Law vs. Criminal Law

.pull-left[

> “If someone shoots you, call a cop. If someone hits your car, call a lawyer.”

- Actually a lot of overlap between criminal law & tort law
  - Some torts have equivalent crimes
  - Intentional vs. unintentional torts
  - Can sue a criminal for damages in civil case

# Torts and Efficiency

  - Should I have to pay damages?

| **Joint** | **-1,000** | **-1,000** | **-1,000** |


- Whatever happens **after** the accident has no apparent effect on efficiency
  - Just redistributing income, each of us obviously has different preference for this
  - No new value created or destroyed

# The Legal Theory of Torts

.pull-left[

- Like contract law, a well-known legal theory of tort liability developed 100 years ago

- A valid tort case (where .blue[Plaintiff] can collect damages from .red[Defendant]) has three elements:
  1. .hi[Harm]

  3. .hi[Breach of duty] (sometimes)

# Harm

- For a tort to exist, the .blue[Plaintiff] needs to have suffered some harm

- “Without harm, there is no tort”

  - Manufacturer exposes workers to a chemical that increases cancer risk by 1%

The other man, carrying a pack- age, jumped aboard the car, but seemed unsteady as if about to fall. A guard on the car, who had held the door open, reached forward to help him in, and another guard on the platform pushed him from behind. In this act, the package was dislodged, and fell upon the rails. It was a package of small size, about fifteen inches long, and was covered by
