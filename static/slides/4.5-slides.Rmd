.pull-left[

- Our model of precaution has made some major assumptions:
  1. People are .hi-purple[rational]
  2. Injurers .hi-purple[pay damages in full]
  3. There are no .hi-purple[regulations] in place other than the liability rule
  4. Parties have no .hi-purple[insurance]
  5. .hi-purple[Litigation is costless]
  6. Compensation is perfect

- What happens in real life when each of these things is not true?

# Rationality

# (Ir)rationality

.pull-left[

- .hi[Behavioral economics]: people systematically suffer from cognitive biases
  - (at least, compared to the predictions of neoclassical economic theory)

- Relevant to our purposes, people are awful at estimating probability

# (Ir)rationality and Probability

.pull-left[

- Hindsight bias

- Recall bias & Recency bias
  - People only remember the most shocking, or recent, event
  - Overestimate the probability of its occurrence
  
- Fixate on exotic, newsworthy, very low-probability events
  - But forget about more commonplace hazards that are more dangerous

# (Ir)rationality and Probability

.pull-left[

- .hi-green[Example]: accidents with power tools

- Manufacturers could design them to be safer, and consumers could use them more cautiously

- Suppose consumers *under*estimate the risk of an accident

- Negligence with defense of contributory negligence, assuming rational consumers
  - Both parties take due care $(x^\star, y^\star)$
  - leads to tools that are safe *when used correctly*

# (Ir)rationality and Probability

.pull-left[

- But with **irrational** consumers who **underestimate** risk
  - Negligence rule leads to too high number of accidents
  - People assume “a product on the market must be safe” and use improperly

- However, a **strict liability** rule is better
  - Manufacturer knows consumers will probably be negligent in using product
  - Design product to be extra safe (“idiot-proof”)

# Rationality and Momentary Lapses

.pull-left[

- Another aspect of this problem: unintended, momentary lapses of judgment

> “[M]any accidents result from tangled feet, quavering hands, distracted eyes, slips of the tongue, wandering minds, weak wills, emotional outbursts, misjudged distances, or miscalculated consequences,” (Cooter & Ulen)

- A lot of negligence is innocently accidental
  - People do try to exercise due care, but once in a while, they fail
]

.pull-right[

]

---

# Rationality and Momentary Lapses

.pull-left[

- A liability rule that required **intentional** negligence, rather than **accidental** negligence would be impossible to enforce
  - Proving intent is even harder than proving negligence
  - Most injurers would avoid liability altogether, and then take no precautions as a result!

- Note there *are* intentional torts in common law! They overlap almost entirely with criminal offenses:
  - Assault, battery, false imprisonment, conversion, trespass, intentional infliction of emotional distress, etc.

# Judgment-Proof Defendants

---

# Judgment-Proof Defendants

.pull-left[

- Assumption 2: injurers pay damages in full

- We saw strict liability causes .red[Injurer] to fully internalize expected harm done, choose efficient precaution $x^\star$

- But what about the following example:
  - .red[Injurer] causes $1,000,000 worth of harm
  - .red[Injurer] only owns assets worth $100,000
  - Anticipating this, he knows $D<A$...so he doesn’t internalize full cost of harm, takes less than efficient precaution $(x<x^\star)$

- .hi-purple[Judgment-proof defendant]: when .red[Injurer]’s liability is limited by bankruptcy (i.e. can’t afford to pay the full cost of damages)
]

---

# Judgment-Proof Defendants: Businesses

.pull-left[

- What about businesses that are judgment-proof?

- Consider a hazardous waste disposal company
  - One that expects to be in business for a long time has incentives to be very careful, avoid accidents/liability and harm to its reputation (and costs to shareholders)
  - Vs. one that operates recklessly in the hopes of high short-term profit, pay out to shareholders, remain **undercapitalized** and anticipate going bankrupt after the first lawsuit
]

---

.pull-left[

- .hi-green[Example]: Suppose the hazardous waste disposal company transports waste, a spill of which would create $50,000,000 of harm

- Can upgrade their trucks for $225,000 to reduce likelihood of an accident from 1/100 to 1/500
  - MB: Reduces expected harm from $500,000 to $100,000
  - Efficient for them to do so

- If company forced to pay $50m in damages after accident under strict liability, would choose to upgrade their trucks

- But suppose the company is only worth $5,000,000
  - Now, if an accident, pay $5m and go out of business
  - Now the upgrade reduces expected damages from $50,000 to $10,000; not worth the cost!

- Thus, judgment-proof business takes less than efficient amount of caution
]

---

# Regulation

.pull-left[

- No perfect solution to these problems

- Whenever liability $>$ injurer’s wealth, liability alone does not create sufficient incentives for efficient precaution

- Regulations that mandate efficient levels of precaution can help mitigate this problem
  - Inspect and assess large fines to firms that do not meet the legal standard *before* any accident happens
  - Also works better than liability when accidents impose small harms on large group of people (nobody finds it worthwhile to sue) [class action lawsuits also get around this problem!]

]

---

# Insurance

.pull-left[

- We have assumed that either .red[Injurer] or .blue[Victim] bears the cost of the accident, depending on liability rule

- But when either (or both) parties have .hi[liability insurance], parties don’t bear full cost of accident! 
  - .hi[Moral hazard problem]: insured parties have weaker incentives to take precaution
  - The liability rule affects *the insurance companies* rather than drivers or pedestrians

]

---

# Insurance

.pull-left[

- However, in real life, insurance tends to be incomplete, largely because insurance companies try to combat moral hazard:
  - Car insurance might have a deductible, coinsurance, or copayment policy; might only cover tangible harms
  - Accident often causes insurance premiums to rise, so injurer not completely insulated from accident costs; alternatively, discounts for good behavior, Drivers' Education, etc.
  - Insurance company may impose safety standards required for policyholders to meet
      - Can make even insured injurers face liability for their negligence!
]

---

# Litigation Costs

.pull-left[

- So far, we’ve assumed litigation costs nothing

- If litigation is costly (and it is!), it affects incentives in opposing directions:

- If litigation is costly for .blue[Victims], they may bring fewer suits
  - Some accidents go “unpunished,” leading to less incentive for .red[Injurer] precaution

- If being sued is costly for .red[Injurers], they internalize more than the cost of the accident
  - Have more incentive for precaution
]

---

.pull-left[

- Under strict liability, we saw .red[Injurers] fully internalize the cost of accident, leading to them choosing efficient precaution $(x^\star)$
  - But this assumes cost of being sued = damage done
  - If courts are unpredictable, and litigation costly, private cost of being sued could $>$ or $<$ cost of accident
  - Leading to too much or too little precaution

- But also...
  - If parties can’t settle out of court, and case goes to trial...
  - then social cost of accident includes both the harm done **and the resources spent on the trial**
]

---

.pull-left[

- Costly litigation brings about the potential of a .hi-purple[“nuisance suit”]
  - Lawsuit with no legal merit, solely intended to extract an out-of-court settlement

- .hi-green[Example]: Suppose trial costs .blue[Plaintiff $10,000] and .red[Defendent $50,000]
  - If case goes to trial, .blue[Plaintiff] will lose, gets nothing
  - Total gains from cooperation $60,000 (avoiding litigation fees)
  - If cooperative surplus split evenly:

| Party | BATNA | Settlement |
|-------|-------|------|
| .blue[Plaintiff] | .blue[-10,000] | .blue[20,000] |
| .red[Defendant] | .blue[-50,000] | .red[-30,000] |

- Defendant pays $20,000 to settle, even though case has no merit!
]

# Who Pays the Litigation Costs?

.pull-left[

- In U.K., the loser often pays the legal fees of the winner, .hi[“The English Rule”]
  - Discourages nuisance suits
  - But also discourages suit where there was actual harm (but hard to prove)

- In U.S., each side generally pays their own legal costs, .hi[“The American Rule”]
  - Some States have laws that change this under certain circumstances
]

---

# Who Pays the Litigation Costs?

.pull-left[

- Rule 68 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:

> “At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer [for a settlement]...
	If the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.”
	
- “Fee-shifting rule”

- .hi-green[Example]: I hit you with my car, you sue me.
  - Before trial, I offer to settle for $6,000, you refuse
  - You win at trial, but damages are only $5,000
  - Then you would have to pay all of my legal expenses after I made the offer 
	
]

---

# Who Pays the Litigation Costs?

.pull-left[

- Rule 68 encourages settlements in two ways:
  1. Gives .red[Defendant] added incentive to **make a serious settlement offer**
  2. Gives .blue[Plaintiff] added incentive to **accept the offer**

- A one-sided rule
  - .blue[Plaintiff] is penalized for rejecting .red[Defendant]'s offer
  - .red[Defendant] is not penalized for rejecting an offer from .blue[Plaintiff]

]

---

# How to Reduce Litigation Costs

.pull-left[

- If all courts cared about was efficiency:

- At the start of every lawsuit, flip a coin
  - Heads: lawsuit proceeds, but damages are doubled
  - Tails: lawsuit immediately dismissed

- Expected damages remain the same, with same incentives for precaution
  - But half as many lawsuits to deal with!

# (Im)perfect Compensation

# (Im)perfect Compensation

.pull-left[

- Perfect compensatory damages $(D=A)$
  - Returns .blue[victim] to pre-accident level of well-being
  - Works like insurance
  - Sets correct incentive for .red[Injurers]

- But in some cases, this is hard to determine
  - Sometimes no amount of damages awarded to make .blue[victim] indifferent
  - Loss of a leg? Loss of a child? Loss of life?

# (Im)perfect Compensation

.left-column[

![:scale 100%](../images/court1.jpg)
]
]

.right-column[

> “Recovery for wrongful death represents damages to the survivors for the loss of value of decedent’s life.  There is no special formula under the law to assess the plaintiff’s damages...
> It is your obligation to assess what is fair, adequate, and just.
> You must use your wisdom and judgment and your sense of basic justice to translate into dollars and cents the amount which will fully, fairly, and reasonably compensate the next of kin for the death of the decedent.
> You must be guided by your common sense and your conscience on the evidence of the case...”

- Recommended jury instructions, State of Massachusetts

> “...You should award reasonable compensation for the loss of love, companionship, comfort, affection, society, solace or moral support.”

- State of California
]

---

# (Im)perfect Compensation

.pull-left[

- Another odd feature of compensatory damages

- Most people would rather be horribly injured than killed
  - Means killing someone does more damage than injuring someone

- But compensatory damages tend to be **lower** for a fatal accident than accident where victim is injured but not killed
  - When someone is horribly injured, may require huge amount of money to compensate them
  - In wrongful-death case, damages compensate a victim’s loved ones, but **no attempt to compensate the victim** (who is deceased)
  - So damages tend to be smaller

“In China the compensation for killing a victim in a traffic accident is relatively small—amounts typically range from $30,000 to $50,000—and once payment is made, the matter is over. By contrast, paying for lifetime care for a disabled survivor can run into the millions.”
