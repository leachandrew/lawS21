# Reliance: Example

# Reliance: Example

# Breach

| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | $V-P$ | $D$ |
| Seller's Payoff | $P-C$ | $-D$ |
| Joint Payoff | $V-C$ | $0$ |

---

# Breach with Reliance

| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | $V-R-P$ | $D-R$ |
| Seller's Payoff | $P-C$ | $-D$ |
| Joint Payoff | $V-R-C$ | $-R$ |

--

- Recall condition for efficient breach: $\color{#6A5ACD}{C>V}$
  - cost of performance to .red[promisor] $>$ value of performance to .blue[promisee]

--

- Note since $R$ is a sunk cost, doesn't affect this condition!
  - Joint payoff from performance $>$ joint payoff from breach if: $V-R-C>-R$
  - $R$'s cancel, yielding $\color{#6A5ACD}{C>V}$

---

# Reliance: Example

| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | $V-R-P$ | $D-R$ |
| Seller's Payoff | $P-C$ | $-D$ |
| Joint Payoff | $V-R-C$ | $-R$ |

- Now consider what Seller will *actually* choose to do (once it knows $C)$:

- .hi-purple[Seller will breach when] $$\color{#6A5ACD}{C>P+D}$$
  - Left: benefit of breach (savings in cost)
  - Right: cost of breach (lost price plus damages)
  - Breaches when private benefits $>$ private costs

---

# Reliance: Example

| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | $V-R-P$ | $D-R$ |
| Seller's Payoff | $P-C$ | $-D$ |
| Joint Payoff | $V-R-C$ | $-R$ |

- We want law to incentivize seller to breach only when it is efficient
  - So set $C>P+D$ equal to $C>V$, i.e.
  - .hi-purple[Set damages] $\color{#6A5ACD}{D=V-P}$.hi-purple[, equal to consumer surplus]
  - Seller compensates buyer for the buyer's lost surplus from the exchange

---

# What Do Courts Set Damages At?

.pull-left[

- We know what damages induce efficient breach $(D=V-P)$, but what damages do courts **actually** set in breach cases?

- .hi[Expectation damages]: amount to make the promisor as well off .hi-purple[as if the contract had been performed]
  - by far the most popular method
  - We've seen this induces breach only when it's efficient ✅

]

.pull-right[
| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | $V-R-P$ | $D-R$ |
| Seller's Payoff | $P-C$ | $-D$ |
| Joint Payoff | $V-R-C$ | $-R$ |

]

---

# What Do Courts Set Damages At?

.pull-left[
- .hi[Reliance damages]: amount to make the promisor as well off .hi-purple[as if the contract had never been made]
  - reference point is *pre-contract* status, rather than *post-performance* status
  - buyer's pre-contract payoff was 0, so in breach case, set $D=R$

]

.pull-right[
| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | $V-R-P$ | $D-R$ |
| Seller's Payoff | $P-C$ | $-D$ |
| Joint Payoff | $V-R-C$ | $-R$ |

]

---

# What Do Courts Set Damages At?

.pull-left[

- Under .hi-purple[reliance damages] $(D=R)$, what are seller's incentives to breach?

- Recall seller will *want* to breach when $C>P+D$
  - If $D=R$, then:

- .hi-purple[Seller will want to breach when] $\color{#6A5ACD}{C>P+R}$
  - Since $V-P>R$ (.blue[promisee]'s reliance investment must be less than the gain from performance, otherwise unprofitable to invest!)...,
  - Then $P+R<V$, implying .hi-purple[seller will breach too often under reliance damages] (since $C<V$ is inefficient to breach) 
  
]

.pull-right[
| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | $V-R-P$ | $D-R$ |
| Seller's Payoff | $P-C$ | $-D$ |
| Joint Payoff | $V-R-C$ | $-R$ |

]

---

# What Do Courts Set Damages At?

.pull-left[

- Finally, consider a rule of no damages $(D=0)$

- .red[Promisor] will want to breach whenever $C>P$
  - Will want to breach **even more often** than reliance (or expectation) damages
  - Recall it's only efficient to breach when $C>V$, and $V>P$

# The Hadley v. Baxendale Rule in Our Model

.pull-left[

- Expectation damages under the *Hadley* rule, set:
$$D=V(\hat{R})-P$$
- This is *not* the unlimited damages of $D=V-P$

- Here, damages are limited to *efficient level of reliance* (“reasonably forseeable”), vs. the *actual* level of reliance
