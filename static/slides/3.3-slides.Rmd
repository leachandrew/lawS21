- Recalling in property law:
  - Coase theorem: to get efficient outcomes, let people trade whenever they want to
  - But also exceptions: unalienability rules, e.g. selling uranium to a terrorist

- Similarly with contract law:
  - To get efficient outcomes, generally enforce any contract both parties want enforced
  - But also exceptions: contracts that should not be enforced

# When Should Voluntary Trade Be Prohibited?

.pull-left[

- Situations where promise will not be enforced and no compensation is due

- Two categories of conditions:

1. .hi[Formation defenses]
  - claim that valid contract *does not exist*
  - example: no consideration
  
2. .hi[Performance excuses]
  - Yes, a valid contract exists
  - but circumstances have changed and promisor should be allowed to breach without penalty

# When Should Voluntary Trade Be Prohibited?

.pull-left[

- Most legal doctrines for invalidating a contract have two economic bases:
  1. individuals’ agreement was .hi-purple[not rational]
  2. .hi-purple[high transaction costs] or a .hi-purple[market failure]
      - information, externalities, monopoly, etc.

# Ideal Contract Conditions & Ideal Market Conditions

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Main goal of contract is facilitating gains from trade for efficiency

- Economic theory teaches us that competitive markets maximize gains from trade (and efficiency) when:
  1. Individuals are rational
  2. No externalities
  3. No market power/disproportionate bargaining power
  4. Perfect information
  5. Low transaction costs

- Violations of these conditions often imply a .hi[market failure]
  - analogously, *might* imply a contract should be invalid

.pull-left[

- Contract that violates the law is unenforceable

- Less obvious: contracts that .hi[derogate public policy] are also unenforceable
  - .hi-green[Examples]: victim of a crime rewarding police for catching criminal; contracts in restraint of trade (antitrust law)

- Recall inalienability rules; enforcing these contracts creates negative externalities

- Party that reasonably knew performance was illegal should be liable

  - Zehmer responds: “You haven’t got $50,000 in cash”

- Joke or not, Zehmer behaved exactly as if he actually wanted to sell, wrote what looked like a proper (if unorthodox) contract

# Incompetence: Should Drunkenness Count?

.pull-left[

- Might think Zehmer, being drunk, lacked necessary intent to enter into a contract

- Makes more sense to not easily invalidate a contract just for drunkenness/joking
  - Otherwise, rent-seeking & excessive litigation over *how drunk* someone was, more signing of contracts at bars, etc.

- If you are *visibly* drunk and other party clearly knows, court might be more willing to invalidate (on some other grounds coming soon)

- Moral of the story: .hi-turquoise[don’t get drunk with people who might ask you to sign a contract!]

I offered the Rowleys an unspecified amount of money which they agreed upon, therefore forging a legally binding oral contract,’ Dimmick said in his hand-written court documents. He wants $235,000, in part to pay for the hospital bills that resulted from him being shot by police when they arrested him.”
