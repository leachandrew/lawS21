# Summing Up Errors Under Different Rules

.pull-left[

- So this has the following normative implications:

1. When a court can assess damages more accurately than standard of care, strict liability is better

2. When a court can better assess standards, negligence is better

3. When standard of care is vague, court should err on side of leniency (not encourage excessive precaution)

# Bright-Line Rules vs. Standards

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- In our simple model, the economic goal of tort liability is to minimize total social costs (sum of costs of precaution and expected cost of accidents)

# The Effect of Court Errors

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- If this is the case, .red[Injurers] might avoid liability altogether...in which case they would have no incentive to take precaution!
  - .hi-green[Example]: Negligence requires **me** to figure out the efficient level of care for Coca-Cola; strict liability only requires **Coca-Cola** to figure out its efficient level of care

- Coca-cola likely has better information about their bottling process than I do
  - May explain why .hi-turquoise[strict liability rules have become more common]
