# Sequential Games: Extensive Form

.pull-left[

- We consider an .hi[Entry Game], a .hi-purple[sequential] game played between a potential .hi-red[Entrant] and an .hi-blue[Incumbent]

- A sequence of play: .hi-red[Entrant] moves first, .hi-blue[Incumbent] moves second

- Note: the magnitude of the payoffs don't really matter, only their *relative sizes*
  - Hence, my simple numbers

# Pure Strategies

.pull-left[

- This game is depicted in .hi-purple[“Extensive form”] or a .hi-purple[game tree]

- Each player faces at least one .hi-turquoise[“decision node”] (solid, colored by player)
  - .hi-red[Entrant] chooses between .red[Enter] or .red[Stay Out] at node .red[E.1]
  - .hi-blue[Incumbent] chooses between .blue[Accommodate] or .blue[Fight] at .blue[I.1]
  - Game ends at any .hi-turquoise[“terminal node”] (hollow), and each player earns payoffs (.red[Entrant], .blue[Incumbent])

  - i.e. what a player will choose at *every* possible decision node; think like an .hi-turquoise[algorithm]:
  
&gt; If we reach node 1, then I will play X; if we reach node 2, then I will play Y; if ... 

- .hi-purple["Mixed strategy"]: play a strategy with some probability

- .hi-blue[Incumbent] has 2 pure strategies:
  1. .blue[Accommodate] at .blue[I.1]
  2. .blue[Fight] at .blue[I.1]

- Note .hi-blue[Incumbent]'s strategy only comes into play if .hi-red[Entrant] plays .red[Enter] and the game reaches node .blue[I.1]

# Solving a Sequential Game: Backward Induction

.pull-left[

- .hi[Backward induction]: to determine the outcome of the game, start with the *last-mover* (i.e. decision nodes just before terminal nodes) and work to the beginning

- A process of considering .hi[“sequential rationality”]:

&gt; “If I play X, my opponent will respond with Y; given their response, do I really want to play X?”

- What is that mover's best choice to maximize their payoff?

2. (.hi-red[Stay Out], .hi-blue[Fight])

- But remember, we ignored the *sequential* nature of this game in normal form

- .hi-blue[Incumbent] playing .hi-blue[Fight] at .blue[I.1] is **not a Nash Equilibrium in this subgame!**

&gt; “if you .red[Enter], I will .blue[Fight]!”

# Copyright vs. Patents

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[Idea-expression dichotomy]: copyright scope is limited to the particular *expressions*, whereas patents can cover the *idea per se*

- e.g. for an adventure novel/movie
  - Can copyright characters, text, scenes, artwork, film, etc.
  - Can't copyright the general *idea* of the plot (“boy meets girl” or “the hero's journey”)

Of the music, movies, and books that were produced in 1923-1946 (the first 23 years affected by the recent Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998), less than 6% are commercially available today

# Copyright Challenges: “Limited” Duration

- amazon

- rent-seeking, Mickey Mouse 1998

No Electronic Theft (NET) Act (1997): infringing copyright even if for purposes other than commercial resale is illegal

- dmca anti-circ; safe harbor Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (1998):
§512 Safe Harboring Provisions: any website-owner can avoid liability
for users uploading infringing content by automatically removing the material (“DMCA Takedown Notices”)
§1201 Anti-Circumvention Provisions: manufacturing or using any device that could potentially be used to infringe copyright is illegal


Copyright Term Extension Act (Sunny Bono Act) (1998): Copyright now extends to the life of the author plus 70 years; applied retroactively to all existing copyrights!
