# Sequential Games: Extensive Form

.pull-left[

- We consider an .hi[Entry Game], a .hi-purple[sequential] game played between a potential .hi-red[Entrant] and an .hi-blue[Incumbent]

- A sequence of play: .hi-red[Entrant] moves first, .hi-blue[Incumbent] moves second

- Note: the magnitude of the payoffs don't really matter, only their *relative sizes*
  - Hence, my simple numbers

# Pure Strategies

.pull-left[

- This game is depicted in .hi-purple[“Extensive form”] or a .hi-purple[game tree]

- Each player faces at least one .hi-turquoise[“decision node”] (solid, colored by player)
  - .hi-red[Entrant] chooses between .red[Enter] or .red[Stay Out] at node .red[E.1]
  - .hi-blue[Incumbent] chooses between .blue[Accommodate] or .blue[Fight] at .blue[I.1]
  - Game ends at any .hi-turquoise[“terminal node”] (hollow), and each player earns payoffs (.red[Entrant], .blue[Incumbent])

> If we reach node 1, then I will play X; if we reach node 2, then I will play Y; if ...

  1. .blue[Accommodate] at .blue[I.1]
  2. .blue[Fight] at .blue[I.1]

- Note .hi-blue[Incumbent]'s strategy only comes into play if .hi-red[Entrant] plays .red[Enter] and the game reaches node .blue[I.1]

# Solving a Sequential Game: Backward Induction

.pull-left[

- .hi[Backward induction]: to determine the outcome of the game, start with the *last-mover* (i.e. decision nodes just before terminal nodes) and work to the beginning

- A process of considering .hi[“sequential rationality”]:

> “If I play X, my opponent will respond with Y; given their response, do I really want to play X?”

- What is that mover's best choice to maximize their payoff?

2. (.hi-red[Stay Out], .hi-blue[Fight])

  - What is optimal to play in *that* subgame?

- Consider a set of strategies that is optimal for all players in *every* subgame it reaches
