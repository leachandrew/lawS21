There's a *lot* more to game theory than a one-shot prisoners' dilemma:

- one shot vs. repeated game

- discrete vs. continuous strategies

- perfect vs. incomplete vs. and asymmetric information

- simultaneous vs. sequential game

1. N.E. $\neq$ the "*best*" or *optimal* outcome
  - Recall the Prisoners' Dilemma!

2. Game may have *multiple* N.E.

3. Game may have *no* N.E. (in "pure" strategies)

> “[A] fox is a "wild and noxious beast." Both parties have regarded him, as the law of nations does a pirate, *"hostem humani generis,"*...His depredations on farmers and on barn yards, have not been forgotten; and to put him to death wherever found, is allowed to be meritorious, and of public benefit. Hence it follows, that our decision should have in view the greatest possible encouragement to the destruction of an animal, so cunning and ruthless in his career.”

> “But who would keep a pack of hounds; or what gentleman, at the sound of the horn, and at peep of day, would mount his steed, and for hours together...pursue the windings of this wily quadruped, if, just as night came on, and his stratagems and strength were nearly exhausted, a saucy intruder, who had not shared in the honours or labours of the chase, were permitted to come in at the death, and bear away in triumph the object of pursuit?”

# What Rule?

.pull-left[

- If .hi-purple[Pierson] gets the fox
  - simpler rule: “finders keepers”
  - bright-line, easy to implement, discourages disputes

- If .hi-turquoise[Post] gets the fox
  - better incentives for hunting hard-to-catch noxious animals (like foxes)

- Same tradeoff between simplicity and good incentives as the whaling cases!
