# Recap of Our Approach So Far

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- .hi[Efficiency]
  - maximize total surplus to all individuals
  - scarce resources owned by whoever **values them the most**
  - make changes if social benefit `\(&gt;\)` social cost

- Design legal system that obtains .hi-purple[efficient outcomes]
  - Once the rules are set, people only act in own self-interest, without regard for efficiency
  - So the goal is to .hi-purple[set up the rules so that people acting in their interest will naturally lead to efficient outcomes]

# Recap of Our Approach So Far

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[Coase]'s insights give us a way to accomplish this:

&gt; If .hi-purple[transaction costs are low], with .hi-purple[well-defined] and .hi-purple[tradeable property rights], parties can bargain voluntarily to reach the efficient outcome. 

- So the initial allocation of rights doesn't matter for efficiency

- **But** if transaction costs are high, we may not get the efficient outcome

# Recap of Our Approach So Far

.pull-left[

- Led us to two .hi-purple[normative] guidelines for designing an efficient legal system:
  1. Minimize transaction costs to facilitate exchange
  2. Allocate rights as efficiently as possible

- Tradeoff between .hi-purple[injunctive relief] and .hi-purple[damages]

# Recap of Our Approach So Far

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Law of .hi[property] works well for **spot** transactions

- Law of .hi[contracts] allow for more complicated **non-simultaneous** trade
  - enables cooperation and credible promises
  - encourages efficient disclosure of information
  - secures efficient commitment to performance
  - secures efficient reliance
  - supplies efficient default rules and regulations
  - fosters enduring relationships

# Recap of Our Approach So Far

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- So far, we have only examined .hi-turquoise[voluntary exchange] and mutual consent
  - Parties reach an agreement *in advance* of transaction (though circumstances might change after the agreement)

- Up next: .hi-turquoise[“involuntary exchange”]
  - Parties who did *not* have an agreement before their (unfortunate) interaction
  - .hi-green[Example]: you are bicycling to class, I am texting while driving, and I hit you...
  - You did not want to deal with me, I did not want to deal with you, but here we are...

# Recap of Our Approach So Far...In Other Words

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- .hi-purple[Property law]: situations where transaction costs are low enough to get agreement ahead of time (some exceptions of course!)

- .hi-purple[Contract law]: situations where transaction costs are low enough for us to agree to a contract, but high enough that we might not want to renegotiate the contract later (when something unexpected happens)

- .hi[Tort law]: situations where transaction costs are **too high to agree on anything in advance**

# An Example

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- .hi-green[Example]: I am distracted and hit you with my car while you are bicycling to class
  - I did not *want* or *intend* to hit you

- Put aside questions of justice and retribution...and simply consider incentives

- Distracted driving (and hitting people) clearly imposes a serious negative externality on others

- Without any laws, we expect more than the efficient amount of distracted driving

- Society needs to design law to discourage this behavior
  - How do we do this?

# An Example

- Harder with tort law, because I did not intend to hit you (and we had no prior agreement)

- I made a choice ahead of time (to be distracted) that increased the likelihood of an accident

--

.center[
![:scale 75%](../images/tortcause.png)
]

- So how do we create an incentive to avoid this type of outcome?

- Can imagine several ways

---

# An Example

.center[
![:scale 75%](../images/tortcause.png)
]

--

1. Punish the **choice** (criminal law, regulations): make it *illegal* to drive distracted (even if you don't hit anyone)

--

2. Punish the **outcome** (.hi[“Strict liability”]): if you hit someone, *regardless* of the choice you made, (distracted or not), you are liable

--

3. Punish the **combination** of choice &amp; outcome (“.hi[“Negligence”]): if you hit someone, and you made a bad choice increasing the probability of an accident, you are liable

---

# Tort Law

.pull-left[

- .hi[Tort]: *noun.* (French): injury

- Contract law: where someone harms you by breaking a promise they made

- Tort law: where someone harms you *without* having made any promises

# Tort Law vs. Criminal Law

.pull-left[

&gt; “If someone shoots you, call a cop. If someone hits your car, call a lawyer.”

- Actually a lot of overlap between criminal law &amp; tort law
  - Some torts have equivalent crimes
  - Intentional vs. unintentional torts
  - Can sue a criminal for damages in civil case
  - O.J. Simpson example

# Torts and Efficiency

.pull-left[

- As usual, we will focus on attaining efficient outcomes

- I hit you with my car, causing $1,000 worth of damage to you (no damage to me)
  - Should I have to pay damages?

# Torts and Efficiency

.pull-left[
.smallest[

Suppose the law holds me liable for:

|   | Nothing | $1,000 | $50,000 |
|----|----|----|----|
| .blue[You] | .blue[-1,000] | .blue[0] | .bkue[49,000] |
| .red[Me] | .red[0] | .red[-1,000] | .red[-50,000] |
| **Joint** | **-1,000** | **-1,000** | **-1,000** |


- Whatever happens **after** the accident has no apparent effect on efficiency
  - Just redistributing income, each of us obviously has different preference for this
  - No new value created or destroyed
  
- ...this can't be the way to think about efficiency

# Remember the First Day of Class...

- Everything that happens *after* the accident merely affects **distribution**, not efficiency

- Damage is *already* done, lawsuit = how to clean up the mess:
  - assign blame
  - maybe punish someone
  - maybe compensate

# Remember the First Day of Class...

.pull-left[

- .hi-turquoise[Before] the incident, lots of .hi-turquoise[decisions] were made, e.g.
  - how much to invest in precaution (how fast to drive, wearing a helmet while biking, etc)
  - reaching a contractual agreement
  - transforming my property (planting trees that block my neighbor's view)
  - relying on my supplier to deliver on time

# The Legal Theory of Torts

.pull-left[

- Like contract law, a well-known legal theory of tort liability developed 100 years ago

- A valid tort case (where .blue[Plaintiff] can collect damages from .red[Defendant]) has three elements:
  1. .hi[Harm]
  2. .hi[Causation]
  3. .hi[Breach of duty] (sometimes)

]

.pull-right[

# Harm

.pull-left[

- For a tort to exist, the .blue[Plaintiff] needs to have suffered some harm

- “Without harm, there is no tort”

- .hi-green[Examples]:
  - Gas station sells gas with defective additive to cars with custom carburetors
  - Manufacturer exposes workers to a chemical that increases cancer risk by 1%

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Consider some preference relationship between money and health

- Accident has caused injured party (.blue[Plaintiff]) to suffer harm
  - Model as fall to lower indifference curve

- .hi-turquoise[Perfect compensation] would restore .blue[Plaintiff] to original level of well-being
  - Return to original indifference curve
  - Again, often via money damages
  - Sometimes, can't restore health, must find some equivalent amount of of money to compsensate

# Harm: Perfect Compensation

.pull-left[

- Many of the harms are .hi-turquoise[tangible]:
  - Medical costs
  - Lost income
  - Damaged property

- But there can also be .hi-turquoise[intangible harms]:
  - Emotional distress
  - Pain and suffering
  - Loss of companionship

# Harm: Perfect Compensation

.pull-left[
- In theory, perfect compensation should cover all these harms
  - Historically, courts were less willing to compensate for intangible harms (hard to measure)
  - Over time, U.S. courts have been compensating more for intangible harms

]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/emotionalpain.jpg)
]

---

# Harm: Perfect Compensation

.pull-left[
- Should we compensate for intangible harms?

- **Pros**: the closer liability is to the full harm done, the better the incentive to avoid these harms (internalize the full externality)

- **Cons**: hard to measure, subjective value, high variance in award sizes, incentive to rent-seek?

&gt; “Plaintiff [Mrs. Palsgraf] was standing on a platform of defendant’s railroad after buying a ticket to go to Rockaway Beach. A train stopped at the station, bound for another place. Two men ran forward to catch it. One of the men reached the platform of the car without mishap, though the train was already moving. The other man, carrying a pack- age, jumped aboard the car, but seemed unsteady as if about to fall. A guard on the car, who had held the door open, reached forward to help him in, and another guard on the platform pushed him from behind. In this act, the package was dislodged, and fell upon the rails. It was a package of small size, about fifteen inches long, and was covered by
a newspaper. In fact it contained fireworks, but there was nothing in its appearance to give notice of its contents. The fireworks when they fell exploded. The shock of the ex- plosion threw down some scales at the other end of the platform many feet away. The scales struck the plaintiff, causing injuries for which she sues.”

- Our main example was a car hitting a bicyclist, in real life:
  - Driver probably has insurance
  - Some damage to bicycle and to driver’s car
  - Driver and bicyclist may not even know what the law is

- We will simplify a lot by assuming:
  - Only one party is harmed
  - Parties know the law
  - Parties don’t have any insurance (for now)
  - Focus only on one party’s precaution at a time
