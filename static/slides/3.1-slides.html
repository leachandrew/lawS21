# Summing Up So Far

.pull-left[
- Suppose we set up rules, and everyone does what’s best for them within the rules
  - What rules do we want to set up, if we want efficient outcomes?

- Some ideas:
  - Coase: initial rules don’t matter for efficiency if transaction costs are low
  - More complicated rules can lead to more efficient use of a resource, but at higher cost
  - Injunctive relief when transaction costs are low, damages when costs are high

# Transaction Costs of Bargaining

.pull-left[
- When two parties want to reallocate rights
  - I want to buy your car
  - Or you want to “buy” my permission to have a noisy party
  - Or neighbors want to pay a factory to pollute less

- We’ve assumed they’ve been able to do so
  - Maybe with some transaction costs

# The Timing of Exchange

.pull-left[

- But there are many other bargaining costs that make exchanges difficult

- Example: one type of problem is timing

- .hi[“Spot” transactions] happen on the spot
  - I hand you a check and you hand me keys to your car
  - You pay for a restaurant meal
  - Maybe some search &amp; bargaining costs, but no enforcement costs

- Many transactions are more complex

  - Painting a house
  - Fixing a car

- There’s now additional .hi[enforcement costs] to ensure parties uphold their side of the bargain

# The Bargain Theory of Contracts: Terms

- In a bargain, both sides must give up something: .hi-purple[reciprocal inducement]

- .hi[Consideration]: what promisee gives to promisor, in exchange for promise

# No Distinctions Between Fair &amp; Unfair Bargains

.pull-left[

# The Limits of Bargain Theory

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- Bargain theory of contract highly influential, but two major problems:

1. Not an accurate description of what courts actually do
  - Courts do sometimes rule some contracts “unconscionable” 
2. Not always economically efficient
  - Would not enforce some promises that both parties want to be enforceable
  - Enforces some promises that should not be enforced
  - Often due to lack of consideration

- We agree to price of $350,000

- Whenever my cost is below $500,000:
  - I'm better off keeping my promise
  - It's efficient for me to build the plane

- Whenever my cost is above than $500,000:
  - I'm better off breaking my promise and paying damages
  - It's efficient for me to not build the plane

# An Externalities View

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- If I breach our contract, I impose a negative externality on you
  - You expected $150,000 payoff if I performed
  - so if I breach, you're $150,000 worse off

- If I have to pay you $150,000 damages if I breach, then .hi-purple[I internalize the externality]
  - Now my action no longer affects your payoff
  - You get the same surplus ($150,00) whether or not I build the plane
  - With externality internalized, I choose efficiently when deciding to perform or breach

# Why Breach Penalties Matter

.pull-left[

- Instead of expectation damages, what if penalty for breach were different?

- Suppose no penalty
  - If costs rise to $400,000, I will breach
  - but it would be efficient to perform

- Suppose penalty is $1,000,000
  - If costs rise to $700,000, I will perform
  - but it would be efficient to breach
