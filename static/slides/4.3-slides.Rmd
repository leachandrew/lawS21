# The Standard of Care

- U.S. courts have consistently *misapplied* the Hand Rule (if their goal is efficiency)

- Efficient level of precaution $x^\star$ should be based on minimizing **total social cost** of accident
  - This includes **both** harm to victim (.hi-purple[“risk to others”]) and to injurer (.hi-purple[“risk to self”])
  - Social benefit of me driving carefully is reduced risk of harm to pedestrians/bikers *and* to me! 
  - Courts have tended to only count risk to *others* when calculating benefit of precaution $(PL)$

- If this is the case, .red[Injurers] might avoid liability altogether...in which case they would have no incentive to take precaution!

- On the other hand, **systematic errors** will skew .red[Injurer]’s incentives

- .hi-green[Example]: suppose damages are set too low, $D<A$

  - New private cost for .red[Injurer] to minimize: $\color{blue}{wx+p(x)D}$ at $x_2$
  - .red[Injurer] would internalize less than full social cost of accidents, **underinvest** in precaution $x_2<x^\star$

- Under a .hi[negligence rule]

- Random errors in setting damages have no effect

- .hi-green[Example]: assume court had again accidentally set too high damages, $D>A$

- Recall negligence is a threshold rule, private cost to .red[injurer] is:
$$\begin{cases}
p(x)A+wx && \text{if } x<x^l\\
wx && \text{if } x \geq x^l\\
\end{cases}$$

- So assuming the standard is set correctly, small errors in actual damages have no affect on .red[Injurer] precaution!

# Summing Up Errors Under Different Rules

- So this has the following normative implications:

1. When a court can assess damages more accurately than standard of care, strict liability is better

2. When a court can better assess standards, negligence is better

3. When standard of care is vague, court should err on side of leniency (not encourage excessive precaution)

- In our simple model, the economic goal of tort liability is to minimize total social costs (sum of costs of precaution and expected cost of accidents)
