  - I signed a contract with no intention of upholding it
  - or I signed it in good faith, intending to keep it
  - but circumstances changed, making my performance less desirable, maybe inefficient!

  - **no longer efficient** to deliver
- .purple[Another brewery] (with `\(V'&gt;V)\)` could show up and offer the .red[ice company] `\(P'&gt;P\)`

`$$D=V-P$$`

- Set **liability from breach = .blue[promisee]'s net gain from performance**, then .red[promisor] will only breach when it is efficient
  - When .red[promisor] breaches, should owe penalty **exactly equal to** the benefit .blue[promisee] expected to recieve

]
- Suppose the two companies agree on a price `\(P\)` and the .red[ice company] *expects* `\(\mathbb{E}[C]&lt;P\)`

# Reliance

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Suppose that in preparation for sale, the .blue[brewery] invests `\(R\)` in producing a certain amount of beer, prior to the ice actually being delivered

- This is a .hi[reliance investment], which depends on the performance of the contract
  - .hi-purple[Increases the value of performance] to .blue[promisee]
  - .hi-purple[Increases the social cost of breach]

- Another goal of contract law is to attain .hi-purple[optimal level of reliance]
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/beer_ice.jpg)
]
]

---

# Reliance: Example

.pull-left[

- `\(V\)` depends on the value of `\(R\)`
  - More `\(R\)` makes `\(V\)` higher to promisee

- But must choose `\(R\)` *before* contract is performed/breached (ice delivered or not) and is a .hi[sunk cost] (beer will spoil if ice not delivered)

]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/beer_ice.jpg)

]

# Reliance: Example

.pull-left[

- `\(D\)`: damages the court awards in the event of breach (promisor pays promisee)

- What value of `\(D\)` is efficient, i.e. induces promisor to breach only when it is efficient to do so?

# Breach

| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | `\(V-P\)` | `\(D\)` |
| Seller's Payoff | `\(P-C\)` | `\(-D\)` |
| Joint Payoff | `\(V-C\)` | `\(0\)` |

---

# Breach with Reliance

| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | `\(V-R-P\)` | `\(D-R\)` |
| Seller's Payoff | `\(P-C\)` | `\(-D\)` |
| Joint Payoff | `\(V-R-C\)` | `\(-R\)` |

--

- Recall condition for efficient breach: `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{C&gt;V}\)`
  - cost of performance to .red[promisor] `\(&gt;\)` value of performance to .blue[promisee]

--

- Note since `\(R\)` is a sunk cost, doesn't affect this condition!
  - Joint payoff from performance `\(&gt;\)` joint payoff from breach if: `\(V-R-C&gt;-R\)`
  - `\(R\)`'s cancel, yielding `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{C&gt;V}\)`

---

# Reliance: Example

| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | `\(V-R-P\)` | `\(D-R\)` |
| Seller's Payoff | `\(P-C\)` | `\(-D\)` |
| Joint Payoff | `\(V-R-C\)` | `\(-R\)` |

- Now consider what Seller will *actually* choose to do (once it knows `\(C)\)`:

- .hi-purple[Seller will breach when] `$$\color{#6A5ACD}{C&gt;P+D}$$`
  - Left: benefit of breach (savings in cost)
  - Right: cost of breach (lost price plus damages)
  - Breaches when private benefits `\(&gt;\)` private costs

---

# Reliance: Example

| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | `\(V-R-P\)` | `\(D-R\)` |
| Seller's Payoff | `\(P-C\)` | `\(-D\)` |
| Joint Payoff | `\(V-R-C\)` | `\(-R\)` |

- We want law to incentivize seller to breach only when it is efficient
  - So set `\(C&gt;P+D\)` equal to `\(C&gt;V\)`, i.e.
  - .hi-purple[Set damages] `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{D=V-P}\)`.hi-purple[, equal to consumer surplus]
  - Seller compensates buyer for the buyer's lost surplus from the exchange

---

# What Do Courts Set Damages At?

.pull-left[

- We know what damages induce efficient breach `\((D=V-P)\)`, but what damages do courts **actually** set in breach cases?

- .hi[Expectation damages]: amount to make the promisor as well off .hi-purple[as if the contract had been performed]
  - by far the most popular method
  - We've seen this induces breach only when it's efficient ✅

]

.pull-right[
| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | `\(V-R-P\)` | `\(D-R\)` |
| Seller's Payoff | `\(P-C\)` | `\(-D\)` |
| Joint Payoff | `\(V-R-C\)` | `\(-R\)` |

]

---

# What Do Courts Set Damages At?

.pull-left[
- .hi[Reliance damages]: amount to make the promisor as well off .hi-purple[as if the contract had never been made]
  - reference point is *pre-contract* status, rather than *post-performance* status
  - buyer's pre-contract payoff was 0, so in breach case, set `\(D=R\)`

]

.pull-right[
| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | `\(V-R-P\)` | `\(D-R\)` |
| Seller's Payoff | `\(P-C\)` | `\(-D\)` |
| Joint Payoff | `\(V-R-C\)` | `\(-R\)` |

]

---

# What Do Courts Set Damages At?

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- Under .hi-purple[reliance damages] `\((D=R)\)`, what are seller's incentives to breach?

- Recall seller will *want* to breach when `\(C&gt;P+D\)`
  - If `\(D=R\)`, then:

- .hi-purple[Seller will want to breach when] `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{C&gt;P+R}\)`
  - Since `\(V-P&gt;R\)` (.blue[promisee]'s reliance investment must be less than the gain from performance, otherwise unprofitable to invest!)...,
  - Then `\(P+R&lt;V\)`, implying .hi-purple[seller will breach too often under reliance damages] (since `\(C&lt;V\)` is inefficient to breach) 
  
]
]

.pull-right[
| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | `\(V-R-P\)` | `\(D-R\)` |
| Seller's Payoff | `\(P-C\)` | `\(-D\)` |
| Joint Payoff | `\(V-R-C\)` | `\(-R\)` |

]

---

# What Do Courts Set Damages At?

.pull-left[

- Finally, consider a rule of no damages `\((D=0)\)`

- .red[Promisor] will want to breach whenever `\(C&gt;P\)`
  - Will want to breach **even more often** than reliance (or expectation) damages
  - Recall it's only efficient to breach when `\(C&gt;V\)`, and `\(V&gt;P\)`
