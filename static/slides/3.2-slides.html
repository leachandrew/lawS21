`$$D=V(\hat{R})-P$$`

# Breach

# Breach with Reliance

| Seller's Payoff | `\(P-C\)` | `\(-D\)` |
| Joint Payoff | `\(V-R-C\)` | `\(-R\)` |

--

- Recall condition for efficient breach: `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{C&gt;V}\)`
  - cost of performance to .red[promisor] `\(&gt;\)` value of performance to .blue[promisee]

--

- Note since `\(R\)` is a sunk cost, doesn't affect this condition!
  - Joint payoff from performance `\(&gt;\)` joint payoff from breach if: `\(V-R-C&gt;-R\)`
  - `\(R\)`'s cancel, yielding `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{C&gt;V}\)`

# Reliance: Example

| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | `\(V-R-P\)` | `\(D-R\)` |
| Seller's Payoff | `\(P-C\)` | `\(-D\)` |
| Joint Payoff | `\(V-R-C\)` | `\(-R\)` |

- Now consider what Seller will *actually* choose to do (once it knows `\(C)\)`:

- .hi-purple[Seller will breach when] `$$\color{#6A5ACD}{C&gt;P+D}$$`
  - Left: benefit of breach (savings in cost)
  - Right: cost of breach (lost price plus damages)
  - Breaches when private benefits `\(&gt;\)` private costs

# Reliance: Example

| Payoffs | Performance | Breach |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Buyer's Payoff | `\(V-R-P\)` | `\(D-R\)` |
| Seller's Payoff | `\(P-C\)` | `\(-D\)` |
| Joint Payoff | `\(V-R-C\)` | `\(-R\)` |

- We want law to incentivize seller to breach only when it is efficient
  - So set `\(C&gt;P+D\)` equal to `\(C&gt;V\)`, i.e.
  - .hi-purple[Set damages] `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{D=V-P}\)`.hi-purple[, equal to consumer surplus]
  - Seller compensates buyer for the buyer's lost surplus from the exchange

# What Do Courts Set Damages At?

.pull-left[

- We know what damages induce efficient breach `\((D=V-P)\)`, but what damages do courts **actually** set in breach cases?

- .hi[Expectation damages]: amount to make the promisor as well off .hi-purple[as if the contract had been performed]
  - by far the most popular method
  - We've seen this induces breach only when it's efficient ✅

# What Do Courts Set Damages At?

.pull-left[
- .hi[Reliance damages]: amount to make the promisor as well off .hi-purple[as if the contract had never been made]

# Choosing Reliance

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Optimum reliance for buyer is `\(R^\star\)` (since `\(P\)` is just a constant, derivative is 0)
  - This (again) is the efficient amount of reliance *when performance is certain*
  - .hi-purple[Expectation damages causes the buyer to overinvest in reliance]
  - .hi[Moral hazard problem]: expectation damages fully insures buyer against risk of breach; behaves as if performance were certain!
    - buyer has no incentive to take precautions against possibility of breach!

# Overreliance

.pull-left[

- *Hadley v. Baxendale* (1854)

- Hadley owned a flour mill, crankshaft broke

- Hired Baxendale to transport broken shaft for repair
  - Baxendale shipped by boat instead of by train, causing a delay of a week

- Hadley sued Baxendale for week of lost profits

# Overreliance

.pull-left[

- *Hadley v. Baxendale* (1854) EWHC J70

- Defendant conceded negligence in delaying the delivery, but claimed the requested damages were too high, since the need for the mill to close was only a “remote” possibility

&gt; “The shipper assumed that Hadley, like most millers, kept a spare shaft...Hadley did not inform him of the special urgency in getting the shaft repaired.”

# Hadley v. Baxendale

.right-column[

- Court elucidated the following rule:

.quitesmall[
&gt; “Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to recieve in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the conemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable results of the breach of it.”

# Hadley v. Baxendale

.pull-left[

- *Hadley v. Baxendale* (1854) EWHC J70

- In other words, damages for breach will be .hi[limited] to a .hi[reasonable] level
  - What the parties could have .hi-purple[reasonably foreseen] at the time they made the contract
  - And liable for .hi-purple[no more] than that

- Found the lost profits were not reasonably forseeable, thus not entitled to damages on those

# The Hadley v. Baxendale Rule in Our Model

.pull-left[

- Expectation damages under the *Hadley* rule, set:
`$$D=V(\hat{R})-P$$`
- This is *not* the unlimited damages of `\(D=V-P\)`

- Here, damages are limited to *efficient level of reliance* (“reasonably forseeable”), vs. the *actual* level of reliance
