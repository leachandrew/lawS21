# Precaution

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- As usual, our main concern is with the incentives these various liability rules create

- For torts, focus on parties' incentive to invest in (costly) precaution to avoid accidents
  - Driving/bicyling carefully, installing seatbelts, airbags, wearing helmets, etc.
  - Inspecting products carefully, quality control, independent audits, mandatory work breaks
  - All of these things are **costly** to parties, so there must be some **efficient** level

# A Simple Economic Model of Accidents

.pull-left[

- Our main example was a car hitting a bicyclist, in real life:
  - Driver probably has insurance
  - Some damage to bicycle and to driver’s car
  - Driver and bicyclist may not even know what the law is

- We will simplify a lot by assuming:
  - Only one party is harmed
  - Parties know the law
  - Parties don’t have any insurance (for now)
  - Focus only on one party’s precaution at a time

# A Unilateral Care Model

# A Unilateral Care Model: Definitions/Notation

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- `\(x\)`: amount of precaution taken

- `\(w\)`: cost of each “unit” or precaution
  - total cost of precaution is `\(wx\)`

- `\(p(x)\)`: probability of an accident, given level of `\(x\)`
  - `\(\frac{\partial p(x)}{\partial x} &lt; 0\)`

- `\(A\)`: cost of accident (to victim)
  - expected cost of accidents is `\(p(x)A\)`

- When we examine .red[injurer] we will use `\(x\)`, when we examine .blue[victim] we will use `\(y\)`
  - Your textbook uses `\(x^i\)` and `\(x^v\)`
