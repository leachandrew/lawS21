# Criminal Law

.pull-left[

- State proscribes behaviors deemed to be harmful to property, health, safety, or morals

- Established by statute (legislation)

- Punishes and/or rehabilitates criminal with fines, imprisonment, or execution

- *Highest* burden of proof against Plaintiff (State): .hi-turquoise[“beyond a reasonable doubt”]

.pull-left[

- Two great legal traditions in the West:

- .hi-purple[Civil Law] tradition
  - confusing: we're *not* talking about "civil vs. criminal" here

- .hi[Common Law] tradition

- About 90-95% of the world's population, and world GDP, operates under one (or a mix) of these systems

# Civil Law System

.pull-left[

- Primarily statutes codified into a centralized, rigorous system, serving as the font of all law

- Heavily influenced by Roman Law & Napoleonic reforms:
  - *Corpus Juris Civilis* 529—534 A.D. (“Code of Justinian”)
  - *Code Napoléon* 1804 (“Civil Code of the French”)
  
- Dominates European continent and all former French colonies

# Civil Law System: History

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- French Revolution overthrows the Ancién Regime
  - Extremely unequal and rigid feudalism
  - Law was arbitrary, not uniform, lots of privileges & exemptions (by class and patronage)
  - King's ministers & judges seen as corrupt

- Voided all existing laws and tried to start from scratch, using more “rational” and scientific principles

# Civil Law System: History

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Napoleon commissions legal scholars to develop a uniform set of law for all of France

- Basically set out to write down and derive all law from a blank slate
  - Borrowed heavily from *Code of Justinian*

- Very rationalistic, set of first principles, derive conclusions
  - Not much room for history, customs, or precedent

- Put into an extremely detailed *Code*, exhaustively applies to all forseeable circumstances

# Civil Law System: Features

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[Inquisitorial]: State officials act as judge and jury
  - judge dominates trial and determines the truth
  - Court itself has interest in outcome
  - No jury trials except for most heinous crimes

- Judges must interpret meaning of the code using reason and scholarly commentaries

# Common Law System

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- Primarily .hi[case law] that arise out of individual disputes and .hi-purple[precedent]
  - statutes by legislatures can supersede, but play a smaller role

- Strongly determined by historical customs, practices, and expectations of the community
  - .hi-turquoise[“judge-made law”]

- First arose in England, all former British colonies (including U.S.) follow common law tradition

# Common Law System: History

.pull-left[

- Roots in Germanic, Anglo-Saxon England

- Henry II standardized law in 12<sup>th</sup> Century and made it “common” in all courts across country
  - all judges ruled according to local customs
  - “go out and find the law as it's being practiced"

# Common Law System: Features

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- .hi[Adversarial]: “law” arises out of disputes between two private parties
  - Parties have legal counsel, each run the trial in their clients' interest
  - Role of judge is neutral referee, lawyers follow rules of evidence & procedure

- Jury trials in most (not necessarily all) cases
  - Jury determines questions of fact; judge determines questions of law

# Common Law System: Features

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Judges help settle *specific* disputes by interpreting law, relying heavily on .hi[precedent] (decisions of previous judges in cases with similar facts)
  - judges “discover” the law as it already exists
  - extract common applicable principles out of a variety of individual cases (“case law”)
  - in that sense, they do not “*make* law” like a legislature does
  
- Common law rooted in common practices, evolves over time with new cases and decisions

- .hi-purple[Statutes] enacted by legislatures can change law

> “The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law emodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics. In order to know what it is, we must know what it has been, and what it tends to become...The substance of the law at any given time pretty nearly corresponds, so far as it goes, with what is then understood to be convenient; but its form and machinery, and the degree to which it is able to work out desired results, depend very much upon its past.”

- If you go to (a good) law school in the U.S., you *are not taught* “the law” (“here it is”)

- You read a ton of cases, and are made to *think* about what the law is, by extracting common principles from those cases

- You only learn “the law” of the State you will be barred in when you are studying for the Bar exam!

> “While the process of articulation of pre-existing rules will thus often lead to alterations in the body of such rules, this will have little effect on the belief that .hi[those formulating the rules do no more, and have no power to do more, than to find and express already existing rules], a task in which fallible humans will often go wrong, but in the performance of which they have no free choice. .hi[The task will be regarded as one of discovering something which exists, not as one of creating something new],” (p.78)

One might even say that a sort of .hi[separation of powers had grown up in England, not because the 'legislature' alone made law, but because it did *not*]: because the law was determined by courts independent of the power which organized and directed government, the power namely of what was misleadingly called the 'legislature',” (p.85).

> “.hi[The chief concern of a common law judge must be the expectations which the parties in a transaction would have reasonably formed] on the basis of the general practices that the ongoing order of actions rests on. In deciding what expectations were reasonable in this sense he can take account only of such practices (customs or rules) as in fact could determine the expectations of the parties and such facts as may be presumed to have been known to them. And these parties would have been able to form common expectations, in a situation which in some respects must have been unique, only because they interpreted the situation in terms of what was thought to be appropriate conduct and which need not have been known to them in the form of an articulated rule,” (p.86)

> “By the time the judge is called upon to decide a case, the parties in the dispute will already have acted in the pursuit of their own ends and mostly in particular circumstances unknown to any authority; and the expectations which have guided their actions and in which one of them has been disappointed will have been based on what they regarded as established practices. The task of the judge will be to tell them what ought to have guided their expectations, not because anyone had told them before that this was the rule, but because this was the established custom which they ought to have known. The question for the judge here can never be whether the action in fact taken was expedient from some higher point of view, or served a particular result desired by authority, but only whether the conduct under dispute conformed to recognized rules,” (p.86)
