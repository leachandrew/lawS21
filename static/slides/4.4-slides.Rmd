# Products Liability

.pull-left[

- So far, we have been assuming accidents are entirely between strangers who have no personal or economic relationship

- We now turn to .hi[products liability], an subfield of tort law where the injurer is a business and the victim is a consumer of their product
  - Parties have an economic relationship

# Products Liability

.pull-left[

- Worth studying for three reasons

- Used to be a minor type of tort case, now a major growing and specialized body of law

- Source of growing dissatisfaction with our tort liability system

- Accidents are between parties with a contractual relationship
  - Hybrid of contract and tort law

> “If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequence to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. That is as far as we need to go for the decision of this case...If he is negligent, where danger is to be foreseen, a liability will follow.”

> “Upon an examination of the record, the evidence appears sufficient to support a reasonable inference that the bottle here involved was not damaged by any extraneous force after delivery to the restaurant by defendant. It follows, therefore, that the bottle was in some manner defective at the time defendant relinquished control, because sound and properly prepared bottles of carbonated liquids do not ordinarily explode when carefully handled.”

Concurring opinion (Justice Roger Traynor):

.smallest[
> “[Public policy demands] responsibility be fixed wherever it will most effectively reduce the hazards to life and health inherent in defective products that reach the market...In leaving it to the jury to decide whether the inference has been dispelled, regardless of the evidence against it, the negligence rule approaches the rule of strict liability. It is needlessly circuitous to make negligence the basis of recovery and impose what is in reality liability without negligence. If public policy demands that a manufacturer of goods be responsible for their quality regardless of negligence there is no reason not to fix that responsibility openly.”

- Court held Injurer liable under legal doctrine of .hi-purple[*res ipsa loquitor*] (“the thing speaks for itself”)
  - Evidence of the accident alone is sufficient to hold injurer liable
  - Only a defective Coke bottle would explode

- As due care does not entirely eliminate the risk of accidents under this rule, effectively a rule of .hi[strict liability] for the Injurer

> (1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if

> (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and

> (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.

of the product, and

> (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered
into any contractual relation with the seller.

# Strict Liability for Manufacturers?

- Somewhat misleading to label the rule as “strict liability”

- In addition to harm & causation, Plaintiffs must show product is .hi[defective] in design or manufacture

- Or, if it is inherently dangerous, the manufacturer .hi[failed to warn] consumers of danger
  - e.g. cigarettes, dynamite, lithium ion batteries

# Conclusions

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Contract law is not an adequate remedy for most product related accidents between .red[Producer] and .blue[Consumer]

- In theory, .hi-purple[Coase Theorem] suggests the parties could bargain to fully internalize the accident risk (between $p_{SL}$ and $p_{NL})$

- But high transaction costs prevent this:
  - .blue[Consumer] misperceptions of product risk
  - Inability of .red[producers] to monitor .blue[consumers] carefully using product

- High cost of contracting in the presence of these remote risks disproportionate to the benefits of a negotiated level of safety
  - Cheaper to use the .hi[default rule] of having tort law assign safety
