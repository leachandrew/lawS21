&gt; ‚ÄúYou live in a state where the most severe criminal punishment is life imprisonment. Someone proposes that since armed robbery is a very serious crime, armed robbers should get a life sentence. A constitutional lawyer asks whether that is consistent with the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A legal philosopher asks whether it is just.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúAn economist points out that if the punishments for armed robbery and for armed robbery plus murder are the same, the additional punishment for the murder is zero‚Äîand asks whether you really want to make it in the interest of robbers to murder their victims.‚Äù (p.8)
