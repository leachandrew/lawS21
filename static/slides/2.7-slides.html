# What Would an Efficient Property Law Look Like?

1. .gray[What can be privately owned?]

2. .hi-purple[What can (and can't) an owner do with her property?]

3. .gray[How are property rights established?]

4. .gray[What remedies are available when property rights are violated?]

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- One potential role for government, provision of .hi[public goods]

- To do this, government needs .hi-turquoise[land], which may already be owned by private parties

- In most countries, governments have right of .hi[eminent domain]: can seize property when owner does not want to sell
  - Also called a .hi[“taking”] (because that’s what the government is doing!)

.smaller[
&gt; “Every restriction upon the use of property imposed in the exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some right theretofore enjoyed, and is, in that sense, an abridgment by the States of rights in property without making compensation. But restriction imposed to protect the public health, safety or morals from dangers threatened is not a taking. The restriction here in question is merely the prohibition of a noxious use. The property so restricted remains in the possession of its owner.  The State does not appropriate it or make any use of it. The State merely prevents the owner from making a use which interferes with paramount rights of the public.”
