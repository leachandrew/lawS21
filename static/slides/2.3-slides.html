&gt; “All this while no supply was heard of, neither knew they when they might expect any. So they began to think how they might raise as much corn as they could, and obtain a better crop than they had done, that they might not still thus languish in misery.”

&gt; “[A]fter much debate of things, the Governor...gave way that they should set corn every man for his own particular, and in that regard trust to themselves; in all other things to go on in the general way as before. And so assigned to every family a parcel of land, according to the proportion of their number, for that end...This had very good success, for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more corn was planted than otherwise would have been by any means the Governor or any other could use, and saved him a great deal of trouble, and gave far better content. The women now went willingly into the field, and took their little ones with them to set corn; which before would allege weakness and inability; whom to have compelled would have been thought great tyranny and oppression.”

&gt; “The experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser than God. For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been to their benefit and comfort. For the young men, that were most able and fit for labour and service, did repine that they should spend their time and strength to work for other men's wives and children without any recompense. The strong, or man of parts, had no more in division of victuals and clothes than he that was weak and not able to do a quarter the other could; this was thought injustice. The aged and graver men to be ranked and equalized in labours and victuals, clothes, etc., with the meaner and younger sort, thought it some indignity and disrespect unto them. And for men's wives to be commanded to do service for other men, as dressing their meat, washing their clothes, etc., they deemed it a kind of slavery, neither could many husbands well brook it. Upon the point all being to have alike, and all to do alike, they thought themselves in the like condition, and one as good as another; and so, if it did not cut off those relations that God hath set amongst men, yet it did at least much diminish and take off the mutual respects that should be preserved amongst them. And would have been worse if they had been men of another condition. Let none object this is men's corruption, and nothing to the course itself. I answer, seeing all men have this corruption in them, God in His wisdom saw another course fitter for them.”

&gt; “.hi[A primary function of property rights is that of guiding incentives to achieve a greater internalization of externalities]. Every cost and benefit associated with social interdependencies is a potential externality. One condition is necessary to make costs and benefits [become] externalities. The cost of a transaction in the rights between the parties (internalization) must exceed the gains from internalization. In general, transacting cost can be large relative to gains because of ‘natural’ difficulties in trading or they can be large because of legal reasons,” (p.348).

&gt; “Property rights develop to internalize externalities when the gains from internalization become larger than the costs of externalization,” (p.350).

&gt; “A close relationship existed, both historically and geographically, between the development of private rights in land and the development of the commercial fur trade.

&gt; “Because of the lack of control over hunting by others, it is in no person’s interest to invest in increasing or maintaining the stock of game.  Overly intensive hunting takes place.

&gt; “Before the fur trade became established, hunting was carried on primarily for purposes of food and the relatively few furs that were required for the hunter’s family.  The externality was clearly present...but these external effects were of such small significance that it did not pay for anyone to take them into account.” (p.351).

&gt; “[T]he advent of the fur trade had two immediate consequences. First, the value of furs to the Indians was increased considerably. Second, and as a result, the scale of hunting activity rose sharply. Both consequences must have increased considerably the importance of the externalities associated with free hunting. The property right system began to change.”

&gt; “[Algonkians and Iroquois] divide themselves into several bands in order to hunt more efficiently. It was their custom...to appropriate pieces of land about two leagues square for each group to hunt exclusively. Ownership of beaver houses, however, had already become established, and when discovered, they were marked. A starving Indian could kill and eat another's beaver if he left the fur and the tail.”

&gt; “The principle of the Indians is to mark off the hunting ground selected by them Dy blazing the trees with their crests so that they may never encroach on each other...By the middle of the century these allotted territories were relatively stabilized,” (p.352).

# Summarizing Coase &amp; Demsetz

.pull-left[

- **Coase**: if property rights are clearly defined and tradeable, we'll get efficient outcomes
  - Fix externalities by expanding property rights

- **Demsetz**: yes, but this comes at a .hi-purple[cost]!
  - Property rights will expand only when the .hi-purple[benefits outweigh the costs]
  - Either because benefits rise, or costs fall

&gt; “If market transactions were costless, all that matters (questions of equity apart) is that the rights of the various parties should be well-defined and the results of legal actions easy to forecast.

&gt; “But...the situation is quite different when market transactions are so costly as to make it difficult to change the arrangement of rights established by the law.”

&gt; “In such cases, the courts directly influence economic activity.”

&gt; “Even when it is possible to change the legal delimitation of rights through market transactions, it is obviously desirable to reduce the need for such transactions and thus reduce the employment of resources in carrying them out.”

# Transaction Costs

.pull-left[
- .hi[Transaction costs]: the costs of voluntary exchange (or markets)
  - .hi-purple[Search costs]: cost of finding trading partners
  - .hi-purple[Bargaining costs]: cost of reaching an agreement
  - .hi-purple[Enforcement costs]: **trust** between parties, cost of upholding agreement, dealing with unforeseen contingencies, punishing defection, using police and courts

# Transaction Costs and the Law

.pull-left[

- When transaction costs are low
  - bargaining is easy
  - initial allocation of property rights doesn't matter, can trade until reach efficient outcome

- When transaction costs are high
  - bargaining is hard
  - initial allocate of property rights *does* matter, since trade may not occur (or is costly)
