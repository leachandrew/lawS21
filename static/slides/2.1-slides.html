.pull-right[

There's a *lot* more to game theory than a one-shot prisoners' dilemma:

- one shot vs. repeated game

- discrete vs. continuous strategies

- perfect vs. incomplete vs. and asymmetric information

- simultaneous vs. sequential game

- See my [game theory course](https://ryansafner.com/courses/econ316/) for more (likely taught next in Fall 2021)

- We use .hi-purple["solution concepts"] to allow us to predict an .hi-purple[equilibrium] of a game

- Important about Nash equilibrium:

1. N.E. `\(\neq\)` the "*best*" or *optimal* outcome
  - Recall the Prisoners' Dilemma!

2. Game may have *multiple* N.E.

3. Game may have *no* N.E. (in "pure" strategies)

# Why Do We Need Property Law?

.pull-left[

- Suppose there are many farmers that face the same problem

- They recognize that establishing rules of property and punishing theft gets them the Pareto improvement
  - Setting up a property law system (and someone to enforce it) has costs `\(c\)`
  - The punishment to theft is `\(P\)`

- If `\(10-c&gt;12-P\)`, then (.red[Farm],.blue[Farm]) becomes an equilibrium

# Property Rights

&gt; “Property is a bundle of legal rights over resources that the owner is free to exercise and whose exercise is protected from interference by others” (Cooter and Ulen, p.73)

&gt; possess, use, develop, improve, transform, consume, deplete, destroy, sell, donate, bequeath, transfer, mortgage, lease, loan, or exclude others

# Property Rights

.pull-left[

- Three important legal points about property rights:
  1. These rights are .hi[impersonal] — they attach to property, not persons
  2. Owner is free to exercise rights over her property (law neither forbids nor obliges)
  3. Others are forbidden to interfere with owner’s exercise of her rights

# Property Rights

.pull-left[
- Any property system must answer:
  1. What can be privately owned?
  2. What can (and can't) an owner do with her property?
  3. How are property rights established?
  4. What remedies are available when property rights are violated?

# “The Fox Case”

.pull-left[

- Legal question: When do you own an animal?

- NY Supreme Court ruled for .hi-purple[Pierson] (who killed fox)

&gt; “If the first seeing, starting, or pursuing such animals...should afford the basis of actions against others for intercepting and killing them, .hi[it would prove a fertile source of quarrels and litigation]”

# “The Fox Case”

- Legal question: When do you own an animal?

- The dissenting opinion sided with .hi-turquoise[Post]:
  - a fox is a “wild and noxious beast”
  - killing foxes is of “meretorious and of a public benefit”

# What Rule?

.pull-left[

- If .hi-purple[Pierson] gets the fox
  - simpler rule: “finders keepers”
  - bright-line, easy to implement, discourages disputes

- If .hi-turquoise[Post] gets the fox
  - better incentives for hunting hard-to-catch noxious animals (like foxes)

- Same tradeoff between simplicity and good incentives as the whaling cases!
