There's a *lot* more to game theory than a one-shot prisoners' dilemma:

- one shot vs. repeated game

- discrete vs. continuous strategies

- perfect vs. incomplete vs. and asymmetric information

- simultaneous vs. sequential game

- See my [game theory course](https://ryansafner.com/courses/econ316/) for more (likely taught next in Fall 2021)

1. N.E. `\(\neq\)` the "*best*" or *optimal* outcome
  - Recall the Prisoners' Dilemma!

2. Game may have *multiple* N.E.

3. Game may have *no* N.E. (in "pure" strategies)
