- As usual, our main concern is with the incentives these various liability rules create

- For torts, focus on parties' incentive to invest in (costly) precaution to avoid accidents
  - Driving/bicyling carefully, installing seatbelts, airbags, wearing helmets, etc.
  - Inspecting products carefully, quality control, independent audits, mandatory work breaks
  - All of these things are **costly** to parties, so there must be some **efficient** level

- Our main example was a car hitting a bicyclist, in real life:
  - Driver probably has insurance
  - Some damage to bicycle and to driver’s car
  - Driver and bicyclist may not even know what the law is

- We will simplify a lot by assuming:
  - Only one party is harmed
  - Parties know the law
  - Parties don’t have any insurance (for now)
  - Focus only on one party’s precaution at a time

- $x$: amount of precaution taken

- $w$: cost of each “unit” or precaution
  - total cost of precaution is $wx$

- $p(x)$: probability of an accident, given level of $x$
  - $\frac{\partial p(x)}{\partial x} < 0$

- $A$: cost of accident (to victim)
  - expected cost of accidents is $p(x)A$

- When we examine .red[injurer] we will use $x$, when we examine .blue[victim] we will use $y$
