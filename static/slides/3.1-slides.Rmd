# Summing Up So Far

.pull-left[
- Suppose we set up rules, and everyone does what’s best for them within the rules
  - What rules do we want to set up, if we want efficient outcomes?

- Some ideas:
  - Coase: initial rules don’t matter for efficiency if transaction costs are low
  - More complicated rules can lead to more efficient use of a resource, but at higher cost
  - Injunctive relief when transaction costs are low, damages when costs are high

# Transaction Costs of Bargaining

.pull-left[
- When two parties want to reallocate rights
  - I want to buy your car
  - Or you want to “buy” my permission to have a noisy party
  - Or neighbors want to pay a factory to pollute less

- We’ve assumed they’ve been able to do so
  - Maybe with some transaction costs

# The Timing of Exchange

.pull-left[

- But there are many other bargaining costs that make exchanges difficult

- Example: one type of problem is timing

- .hi[“Spot” transactions] happen on the spot
  - I hand you a check and you hand me keys to your car
  - You pay for a restaurant meal
  - Maybe some search & bargaining costs, but no enforcement costs

  - Neighbors pay factory to pollute less going forward
  - What if technology/cost changes, factory wants to pollute more?

- Other examples:
  - Booking a flight
  - Painting a house
  - Fixing a car

- There’s now additional .hi[enforcement costs] to ensure parties uphold their side of the bargain

# Contracts

.pull-left[

- A .hi[contract] is a .hi[promise] that is legally binding
  - Courts will enforce many (but not all) promises

- Point of contracts: enable trades where the transaction is not concluded immediately (non-spot transactions)

# The Bargain Theory of Contracts: Terms

.pull-left[

- .hi[Promisor]: person who gives a promise

- .hi[Promisee]: person who receives a promise

- In a bargain, both sides must give up something: .hi-purple[reciprocal inducement]

- .hi[Consideration]: what promisee gives to promisor, in exchange for promise
  - Under bargain theory, this is what makes contract enforceable

# No Distinctions Between Fair & Unfair Bargains

.pull-left[

- Bargain theory of contract does *not* distinguish between fair and unfair bargains

- Even a highly one-sided bargain is enforceable under the theory
  - Courts should not determine whether bargain is “fair,” only whether a bargain **occurred**

# Remedies: According to Bargain Theory

.pull-left[

- Since promisee agreed to bargain, owes it to promisor to make her as well off as she .hi-purple[would have been] if the promise had been .hi-purple[performed]
  - but sometimes difficult to calculate, hence, *reasonable* standard

# The Limits of Bargain Theory

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- Bargain theory of contract highly influential, but two major problems:

1. Not an accurate description of what courts actually do
  - Courts do sometimes rule some contracts “unconscionable” 
2. Not always economically efficient
  - Would not enforce some promises that both parties want to be enforceable
  - Enforces some promises that should not be enforced
  - Often due to lack of consideration
