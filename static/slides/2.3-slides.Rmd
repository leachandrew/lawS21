.hi-green[Example] (from before): Your car is worth $3,000 to you, and $4,000 to me. Suppose I have $10,000 to spend.
]

- .hi[“threat point”] or .hi[“BATNA”] or .hi[“outside option”] is value we each get if we don't exchange:
  - Mine: $10,000
  - Yours: $3,000

- Any outcome we both consent to must make us at least as well off as our BATNA

- If we don't exchange, payoffs are:
  - Me: 10,000
  - You: 3,000
  - Joint: 13,000

- If I purchase your car at some price $p$, payoffs are:
  - Me: 4,000+10,000-P = 14,000-P
  - You: P
  - Joint: 14,000 (14,000-P+P)
