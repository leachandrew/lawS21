# Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Harm to neighbors ($183,000) much less than the value of the investment in the factory ($45 million), would be inefficient to close the factory

- If transaction costs were low, neighbors could bargain with plant to mitigate harm (pay it to reduce dirt, smoke, vibrations, etc)

- But high transactions costs here (a public nuisance), so court imposed a liability rule to compensate the injured parties
  - keeps plant in operation, property right kept in hands of the more-valued use

- First recognition that sometimes a liability rule is more efficient in some property cases

&gt; “[Ordinarily in property law], where a nuisance has been found and where there has been any substantial damage shown by the party complaining, an injunction will be granted.”

&gt; “To grant the injunction unless defendant pays plaintiffs such permanent damages as may be fixed by the court seems to do justice between the contending parties. All of the attributions of economic loss to the properties on which plaintiffs' complaints are based will have been redressed ... [and i]t seems reasonable to think that the risk of being required to pay permanent damages to injured property owners by cement plant owners would itself be a reasonably effective spur to research for improved techniques to minimize nuisance.”

But if you set out to homestead the land in 1890, you will get an unpleasant surprise: someone else is already there...If you want to get the land you will have to come early. By farming it at a loss for a few years you can acquire the right to farm it thereafter at a profit.”

It follows that the effect of the Homestead Act was to wipe out, in costs of premature farming, a large part of the land value of the United States.”
