- .hi[Criminal] vs. .hi[Civil law]

# Criminal Law

.pull-left[

- State proscribes behaviors deemed to be harmful to property, health, safety, or morals

- Established by statute (legislation)

- Punishes and/or rehabilitates criminal with fines, imprisonment, or execution

- *Highest* burden of proof against Plaintiff (State): .hi-turquoise[“beyond a reasonable doubt”]

# Civil Law

.pull-left[

- Property, contracts, torts, family, business associations, etc

- Statutes, regulations, and case law

- Burden of proof lower: .hi-turquoise[“preponderance of the evidence”] (i.e. 50.1%)

# Criminal Law vs. Civil Law

- Criminal .hi[intended] to do wrong

- Case is brought by the State (“society”), not individual plaintiff

- Tends to be .hi[public harm] in addition to private harms

- .hi[Burden of proof] is higher at trial

- If found guilty, defendant will be .hi[punished]

.pull-left[

- Unlike a tort, a crime generally requires .hi[intent]
  - .hi-purple[Mens rea]: a “guilty mind”

- Literal intent occasionally not required
  - .hi-green[Example]: Criminally negligent homicide (drunk doctor, lifeguard, etc.)

- Sometimes, intent is sufficient for a crime even without harm
  - .hi-green[Example]: Attempted murder

.pull-left[

- Recall wrongful death tort cases
  - Victim is dead, can't receive compensation
  - Family/friends can sue for lost wages, lost companionship, etc.

- Criminal complaints are **brought by the State**

- Potential for prosecution of **“victimless crimes”**
  - Theory: all crimes are .hi-purple[public bads] that harm the public
  - Breakdown of law &amp; order in society harms *everyone*
  - So public (represented by the State) brings criminal suits

# Criminal Law vs. Tort Law: Remedies

.smallest[
- Nuisance (property) law, contract law, tort law: damages serve two purposes:
  1. Compensate the .blue[victim]
  2. Incentivize .red[injurer] to internalize cost of harm done

- When .red[injurer] internalizes harm, we get pollution, breach, accidents only when they are efficient

- **Criminal law**: objective is to .hi-purple[deter] crimes, i.e. .hi-purple[prevent them entirely] — not just the “inefficient ones”!
  - Punishment need not be limited to amount of harm done

- Tort law creates an incentive to avoid harms
  - If it worked perfectly, maybe no need for criminal law?

- Shortcomings of tort law for certain offenses:
  - Relies on .hi-purple[perfect compensation], which may be impossible (loss of life, crippling injury)
  - If .hi-purple[probability of being caught/convicted] is small, deterrence requires punishment that is .hi-purple[more severe] than benefit obtained
  - If civil penalties are high enough, criminals might be .hi-purple[judgment-proof]

# Economic Model of Crime and Punishment

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Key assumption: .hi[rational criminals]
  - Potential criminals, on the margin, weigh private cost (chance of getting caught `\(\times\)` severity of punishment) against benefit

- C’mon are they really though?
  - Well, if our goal is deterrence, we are implicitly assuming criminals are rational, at least on the margin!
  - Otherwise, what’s the point?!

- But for a good critical discussion, see Tabarrok, 2015, “What Was Gary Becker’s Greatest Mistake?”

&gt; “Here, as elsewhere in economics, the assumption of rationality does not imply that muggers (or economics professors) calculate the costs and benefits of available alternatives to seventeen decimal places-merely that they tend to choose the one that best achieves their objectives.

&gt; “.hi[If muggers are rational, we do not have to make mugging impossible in order to prevent it, merely unprofitable.] If the benefits of a profession decrease or its costs increase, fewer people will enter it-whether the profession is plumbing or burglary. If little old ladies start carrying pistols in their purses, so that one mugging in ten puts the mugger in the hospital or the morgue, the number of muggers will decrease drastically-not because they have all been shot but because most will have switched to safer ways of making a living. If mugging becomes sufficiently unprofitable, nobody will do it.”

- If enforcement were free, we could eliminate crime
  - Hire enough police to detect nearly all crimes
  - Punish them very severely
  - Nobody rational would commit a crime

If reducing the annual murder rate from ten to zero requires us to turn half the population into police, judges, and prison guards, it is probably not worth doing.”

&gt; “Our first guess might be that the fine should be high enough to deter all crimes. But there may be some crimes we do not want to deter. Consider a hunter, lost and starving in the woods, who comes across a locked cabin containing food and a telephone. The benefit to him of breaking in and calling for rescue is much larger than the cost to the cabin's owner; we will, on net, be better off if that particular offense is not deterred. For a less exotic example, consider the driver who occasionally exceeds the speed limit when he is in a hurry. We could deter all or almost all speeding if we routinely confiscated the cars of convicted speeders-but many of us would regard that as more deterrence than we want.

&gt; “If a crime produces a net benefit, if the gain to the speeder or the lost hunter is more than the loss to the rest of us, we are better off not deterring it. In many cases our legal system permits such "efficient crimes" by not classifying them as crimes. Every time I breath out I exhale carbon dioxide-regarded, in some contexts, as a pollutant. Most of us are confident that this particular offense is an efficient one-we are better off if we put up with a certain amount of extra carbon dioxide than if we all stop breathing. So exhaling, unlike some other forms of pollution, is not illegal. Similarly, the lost hunter of my example would probably be excused from criminal liability under the doctrine of necessity.

&gt; “How, in such situations, can we deter inefficient speeding while permitting efficient speeding? The answer is simple: Set the expected punishment equal to the damage done. Under this rule, criminal punishment functions as a probabilistic price system.”

&gt; “While this may be a reasonable way of looking at speeding, it seems less appropriate for more serious offenses. Do we really have a legal system where the reason we do not raise the punishment for murder is the fear that we would then have too few murders?

&gt; The answer is no. So far I have been describing a world where crime control costs nothing and we therefore buy as much of it as we want. In order to catch and convict criminals we must pay police, hold trials, train lawyers-pay a variety of costs which I will refer to, for convenience, as apprehension costs. Once the criminals are convicted, we must punish them-and that too is costly.”

  - But don’t always work: most criminals are judgment-proof

- Supplement with **imprisonment** `\(t\)` (or even **execution**) for additional deterrence

&gt; “In controlling crime, we can get a given amount of deterrence in many different ways. We might catch half the criminals and fine them each $500, we might catch one criminal in twenty and put him in jail for a year, or we might catch one in five hundred and hang him. Suppose that all of these alternatives are equivalent from the standpoint of the criminal and thus have the same deterrent effect, just as a $100 fine was equivalent, in the earlier example, to one chance in ten of a $1000 fine. Generalizing our earlier term, we may say that all of these alternative combinations of probability and punishment represent the same expected punishment.

&gt; .hi[In choosing among them, we are trading off one kind of cost against another.] It takes fewer policemen to catch five criminals out of a hundred than fifty and fewer judges to try them, so lowering the number we catch while raising their punishment saves on apprehension costs. But, since there is a limit to how large a fine a convicted criminal can pay, raising the punishment typically means shifting from fines to imprisonment or execution-which increases punishment cost. .hi[An efficient law enforcement system would produce any given level of deterrence with whatever combination of probability and punishment minimized the sum of the two sorts of cost.]”

- Society could save money by:

  - Double the punishment to $40,000

- Punishing someone $40,000 may cost society more than punishing them $20,000, but not more than twice as much...and half as many people to punish
  - Cost of punishment is the same or lower, but we’d save money on apprehension
