# The Civil Law vs. Criminal Law Distinction

.pull-left[

- Major areas of law can be split into:

- .hi[Public law] vs. .hi[Private law]
  - laws about relationship between individuals and State
  - laws about relationship between individuals

- .hi[Criminal] vs. .hi[Civil law]

# Criminal Law

.pull-left[

- State proscribes behaviors deemed to be harmful to property, health, safety, or morals

- Established by statute (legislation)

- Punishes and/or rehabilitates criminal with fines, imprisonment, or execution

- *Highest* burden of proof against Plaintiff (State): .hi-turquoise[“beyond a reasonable doubt”]
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/perpwalk.jpg)
]
]

# Civil Law

.pull-left[

- Property, contracts, torts, family, business associations, etc

- Statutes, regulations, and case law

- Burden of proof lower: .hi-turquoise[“preponderance of the evidence”] (i.e. 50.1%)

]

# Civil vs. Criminal Law

.pull-left[

- The same dispute can have both a criminal *and* a civil lawsuit

- O.J. Simpson
  - *The People of the State of California v. Simpson*: acquitted of 1st degree murder (criminal)
  - *Rufo v. Simpson*: lost civil case, Plaintiffs awarded $33.5 million in damages for wrongful death and battery

# Crimes vs. Torts, or Why Do We Need Criminal Law?

---

# Criminal Law vs. Civil Law

.pull-left[
- Criminal .hi[intended] to do wrong

- Case is brought by the State (“society”), not individual plaintiff

- Tends to be .hi[public harm] in addition to private harms

- .hi[Burden of proof] is higher at trial

- If found guilty, defendant will be .hi[punished]

# Criminal Law vs. Tort Law: Intent

.pull-left[

- Unlike a tort, a crime generally requires .hi[intent]
  - .hi-purple[Mens rea]: a “guilty mind”

- Literal intent occasionally not required
  - .hi-green[Example]: Criminally negligent homicide (drunk doctor, lifeguard, etc.)

- Sometimes, intent is sufficient for a crime even without harm
  - .hi-green[Example]: Attempted murder

# Criminal Law vs. Tort Law: Plaintiffs

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- Recall wrongful death tort cases
  - Victim is dead, can't receive compensation
  - Family/friends can sue for lost wages, lost companionship, etc.

- Criminal complaints are **brought by the State**

- Potential for prosecution of **“victimless crimes”**
  - Theory: all crimes are .hi-purple[public bads] that harm the public
  - Breakdown of law &amp; order in society harms *everyone*
  - So public (represented by the State) brings criminal suits

# Criminal Law vs. Tort Law: Remedies

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Nuisance (property) law, contract law, tort law: damages serve two purposes:
  1. Compensate the .blue[victim]
  2. Incentivize .red[injurer] to internalize cost of harm done

- When .red[injurer] internalizes harm, we get pollution, breach, accidents only when they are efficient

- **Criminal law**: objective is to .hi-purple[deter] crimes, i.e. .hi-purple[prevent them entirely] — not just the “inefficient ones”!
  - Punishment need not be limited to amount of harm done

# Criminal Law vs. Tort Law: Standards of Proof

.pull-left[

- Most **civil cases**: .hi-purple[preponderance of the evidence]
  - Interpreted as 51% certainty .blue[Plaintiff] is correct
  - for punitive damages: .hi-purple[clear and convincing evidence] (higher standard)

- **Criminal cases**: .blue[Prosecution] must prove .red[Defendant]'s guilt .hi-purple[beyond a reasonable doubt]

# Criminal Law vs. Tort Law: Standards of Proof

# Criminal Law vs. Tort Law: Stigma

.pull-left[

- Harsher stigma to injurer convicted as a .hi-purple[criminal], rather than a .hi-purple[tortfeasor]

- Loss of civil rights (e.g. voting rights)

- Harder to find work, obtain a loan, find housing

# Why Criminal Law? Why Not Just Tort Law?

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Tort law creates an incentive to avoid harms
  - If it worked perfectly, maybe no need for criminal law?

- Shortcomings of tort law for certain offenses:
  - Relies on .hi-purple[perfect compensation], which may be impossible (loss of life, crippling injury)
  - If .hi-purple[probability of being caught/convicted] is small, deterrence requires punishment that is .hi-purple[more severe] than benefit obtained
  - If civil penalties are high enough, criminals might be .hi-purple[judgment-proof]

# A Theory of Criminal Law

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- A full theory of criminal law must answer:
  1. Which acts should be punished as crimes?
  2. How should they be punished?

- Cooter and Ulen:
  - When goal is .hi-purple[deterrence], acts should be .hi-purple[punished]
  - When goal is .hi-purple[internalization], acts should be .hi-purple[priced]

# A Theory of Criminal Law

.pull-left[

- Our .hi-purple[goal should be deterrence] when:
  - perfect compensation is impossible
  - people want law to protect “rights” instead of “interests” (i.e. consider property rules vs. liability rules)
  - enforcement errors undermine liability

# Economic Model of Crime and Punishment

.pull-left[

- Key assumption: .hi[rational criminals]
  - Potential criminals, on the margin, weigh private cost (chance of getting caught `\(\times\)` severity of punishment) against benefit

- C’mon are they really though?
  - Well, if our goal is deterrence, we are implicitly assuming criminals are rational, at least on the margin!
  - Otherwise, what’s the point?!

- But for a good counter, see Tabarrok “What Was Gary Becker’s Greatest Mistake?”

&gt; “Here, as elsewhere in economics, the assumption of rationality does not imply that muggers (or economics professors) calculate the costs and benefits of available alternatives to seventeen decimal places-merely that they tend to choose the one that best achieves their objectives.

&gt; “.hi[If muggers are rational, we do not have to make mugging impossible in order to prevent it, merely unprofitable.] If the benefits of a profession decrease or its costs increase, fewer people will enter it-whether the profession is plumbing or burglary. If little old ladies start carrying pistols in their purses, so that one mugging in ten puts the mugger in the hospital or the morgue, the number of muggers will decrease drastically-not because they have all been shot but because most will have switched to safer ways of making a living. If mugging becomes sufficiently unprofitable, nobody will do it.”

# Economic Model of Crime and Punishment

.pull-left[
- If enforcement were free, we could eliminate crime
  - Hire enough police to detect nearly all crimes
  - Punish them very severely
  - Nobody rational would commit a crime

- But .hi[enforcement is costly], making this an interesting tradeoff

&gt; “In designing institutions to control crime, our concern is not sin but cost. Eliminating all murders, even all muggings, would no doubt be a fine thing-but whether we ought to try to do it depends on how much it costs. If reducing the annual murder rate from ten to zero requires us to turn half the population into police, judges, and prison guards, it is probably not worth doing.”

&gt; “Our first guess might be that the fine should be high enough to deter all crimes. But there may be some crimes we do not want to deter. Consider a hunter, lost and starving in the woods, who comes across a locked cabin containing food and a telephone. The benefit to him of breaking in and calling for rescue is much larger than the cost to the cabin's owner; we will, on net, be better off if that particular offense is not deterred. For a less exotic example, consider the driver who occasionally exceeds the speed limit when he is in a hurry. We could deter all or almost all speeding if we routinely confiscated the cars of convicted speeders-but many of us would regard that as more deterrence than we want.
