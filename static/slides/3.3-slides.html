# When Should Voluntary Trade Be Prohibited?

.pull-left[

- Recalling in property law:
  - Coase theorem: to get efficient outcomes, let people trade whenever they want to
  - But also exceptions: unalienability rules, e.g. selling uranium to a terrorist

- Similarly with contract law:
  - To get efficient outcomes, generally enforce any contract both parties want enforced
  - But also exceptions: contracts that should not be enforced

# When Should Voluntary Trade Be Prohibited?

.pull-left[
.smallest[

- Situations where promise will not be enforced and no compensation is due

- Two categories of conditions:

1. .hi[Formation defenses]
  - claim that valid contract *does not exist*
  - example: no consideration
  
2. .hi[Performance excuses]
  - Yes, a valid contract exists
  - but circumstances have changed and promisor should be allowed to breach without penalty

# When Should Voluntary Trade Be Prohibited?

.pull-left[
.smallest[

- Most legal doctrines for invalidating a contract have two economic bases:
  1. individuals’ agreement was .hi-purple[not rational]
  2. .hi-purple[high transaction costs] or a .hi-purple[market failure]
      - information, externalities, monopoly, etc.

# Ideal Contract Conditions &amp; Ideal Market Conditions

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Main goal of contract is facilitating gains from trade for efficiency

- Economic theory teaches us that competitive markets maximize gains from trade (and efficiency) when:
  1. Individuals are rational
  2. No externalities
  3. No market power/disproportionate bargaining power
  4. Perfect information
  5. Low transaction costs

- Violations of these conditions often imply a .hi[market failure]
  - analogously, *might* imply a contract should be invalid

# Obvious Cases: Contracts that Break the Law

.pull-left[
.smallest[    
- Contract that violates the law is unenforceable
  - .hi-green[Examples]: buying a kilo of cocaine for $25,000; murder-for-hire

- Less obvious: contracts that .hi[derogate public policy] are also unenforceable
  - .hi-green[Examples]: victim of a crime rewarding police for catching criminal; contracts in restraint of trade (antitrust law)

- Recall inalienability rules; enforcing these contracts creates negative externalities

- Party that reasonably knew performance was illegal should be liable

  - Children
  - Legally insane
  - Intoxicated?

- Doctrine of .hi[incompetence]: one party “not competent to enter into the agreement”

# Incompetence: Lucy v. Zehmer

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- *Lucy v. Zehmer* Virginia Sup Ct 1954

- Zehmer owned a farm (“the Ferguson farm”), Lucy had been trying to buy it for some time

- While out drinking, Lucy “already high as a Georgia pine” offers $50,000
  - Zehmer responds: “You haven’t got $50,000 in cash”
  - ...eventually, Lucy grabs a discarded guest check and writes:

&gt; “We hereby agree to sell W.O. Lucy the Ferguson Farm complete for $50,000.00, title satisfactory to buyer.”

- Zehmer later claims he was drunk and joking: “a bunch of two doggoned drunks bluffing to see who could talk the biggest and say the most”

- Lucy sues for .hi[specific performance]: court issuing an order for the contract to be performed as specified (i.e. Zehmer sell to Lucy for $50,000)

- Court: Zehmer not so drunk as to be “unable to comprehend the nature and consequences” of what he was doing

- Joke or not, Zehmer behaved exactly as if he actually wanted to sell, wrote what looked like a proper (if unorthodox) contract
  - It's not Lucy’s duty to know Zehmer was joking!

- Court held the contract was valid and Zehmer owed .hi[specific performance]

# Incompetence: Should Drunkenness Count?

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Might think Zehmer, being drunk, lacked necessary intent to enter into a contract

- Makes more sense to not easily invalidate a contract just for drunkenness/joking
  - Otherwise, rent-seeking &amp; excessive litigation over *how drunk* someone was, more signing of contracts at bars, etc.

- If you are *visibly* drunk and other party clearly knows, court might be more willing to invalidate (on some other grounds coming soon)

- Moral of the story: .hi-turquoise[don’t get drunk with people who might ask you to sign a contract!]

“A man who held a Kansas couple hostage in their home while fleeing from authorities is suing them, claiming they broke an oral contract made when he promised them money in exchange for hiding him from police. The couple has asked a judge to dismiss the suit...Jesse Dimmick of suburban Denver is serving an 11-year sentence after bursting into Jared and Lindsay Rowley's Topeka-area home in September 2009...Dimmick filed a breach of contract suit in Shawnee County District Court.”

&gt; “‘I, the defendant, asked the Rowleys to hide me because I feared for my life. I offered the Rowleys an unspecified amount of money which they agreed upon, therefore forging a legally binding oral contract,’ Dimmick said in his hand-written court documents. He wants $235,000, in part to pay for the hospital bills that resulted from him being shot by police when they arrested him.”

&gt; “The argument in favor of enforceability is that if the contract is not enforceable, the mugger will refuse your check—or accept it and then make sure you can’t stop payment by killing you and cashing the check before news of your death reaches the bank. Seen from that perspective, it looks as though even a contract made under duress produces benefits for both parties and so should be enforceable. You prefer paying a hundred dollars to being killed, he prefers receiving a hundred dollars to killing you. Where’s the problem?

&gt; “The problem is that making the contract enforceable makes offering people the choice between their money and their life a much more profitable business—most of us have more in our checking accounts than in our wallets. The gain from enforceability is a better chance, if you are mugged, to buy yourself free. It must be balanced against the higher probability of being mugged. It seems likely that the current legal rule, holding contracts made under duress unenforceable, is the efficient one.”

  - Contract signed under duress: losing side facing threat of continuing to battle a superior force

- Most people agree peace treaties being enforceable is a good thing
  - *Ex post*, make war less costly, end it quicker

- Logic: party would not have voluntarily accepted such terms, must have been either incompetent, under duress, or defrauded

We could allocate that risk either to me, by specifying that I will have to pay for the additional construction costs in such a case, or to the builder. Since the builder is building many houses in different places, he can spread the risk; I cannot. From that standpoint at least, our contract should specify a fixed price, whether or not something goes wrong. If the contract does not specify who bears the risk, risk spreading provides an argument for assigning it to the builder” (p.161).

The drunk driver is dead, and his estate bankrupt. Who pays for the losses?” (p.161).

You know what price I am charging, and you know that I am insuring you against the risk of nondelivery. If the contract specified that you had to bear the risk, you would need to know the reliability of alternative sellers as well as their price in order to decide which one is offering the best deal,” (p.162).

- That’s why *Hadley v. Baxendale* rule was so “surprising”
  - Baxendale (shipper) could influence speed of delivery, Hadley (miller) could not 
  - Baxendale was the efficient bearer of delay risk

- But court ruled Baxendale was *not* liable for Hadley’s lost profits, forcing Hadley to bear most of the delay risk/loss
  - This only makes sense as a penalty default (Ayres and Gertner)
  - Creates incentive for Hadley/millers to reveal urgency of the shipment

The photographer does know that these films are especially valuable and can avoid the problem by taking them to a specialist film lab and making sure the proprietor realizes what they are. The efficient rule from the standpoint of moral hazard is to make the photographer liable, because he is the one in the best position to prevent the loss. That, called the rule of *Hadley v.
