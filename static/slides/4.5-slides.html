# Assumptions of our Economic Model of Accidents

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- Our economic model of accidents has made some major assumptions:
  1. People are .hi-purple[rational]
  2. Injurers .hi-purple[pay damages in full]
  3. There are no .hi-purple[regulations] in place other than the liability rule
  4. Parties have no .hi-purple[insurance]
  5. .hi-purple[Litigation is costless]
  6. Compensation is perfect

- It's gotten us some pretty neat and tidy results about efficient rules

- What about in real life when none of these things are true?

# (Ir)rationality and Probability

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- .hi-green[Example]: accidents with power tools

- Manufacturers could design them to be safer, and consumers could use them more cautiously

- Suppose consumers *under*estimate the risk of an accident

- Negligence with defense of contributory negligence, assuming rational consumers
  - Both parties take due care `\((x^\star, y^\star)\)`
  - leads to tools that are safe *when used correctly*

- But with **irrational** consumers who **underestimate** risk
  - Negligence rule leads to too high number of accidents
  - People assume “a product on the market must be safe” and use improperly

- However, a **strict liability** rule is better
  - Manufacturer knows consumers will probably be negligent in using product
  - Design product to be extra safe (“idiot-proof”)

# Rationality and Momentary Lapses

.pull-left[

- Another aspect of this problem: unintended, momentary lapses of judgment

&gt; “[M]any accidents result from tangled feet, quavering hands, distracted eyes, slips of the tongue, wandering minds, weak wills, emotional outbursts, misjudged distances, or miscalculated consequences,” (Cooter &amp; Ulen)

- A lot of negligence is innocently accidental
  - People do try to exercise due care, but once in a while, they fail

# Rationality and Momentary Lapses

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- A liability rule that required **intentional** negligence, rather than **accidental** negligence would be impossible to enforce
  - Proving intent is even harder than proving negligence
  - Most injurers would avoid liability altogether, and then take no precautions as a result!

- Note there *are* intentional torts in common law! They overlap almost entirely with criminal offenses:
  - Assault, battery, false imprisonment, conversion, trespass, intentional infliction of emotional distress, etc.

# Judgment-Proof Defendants

.pull-left[

- Assumption 2: injurers pay damages in full

- .hi-purple[Judgment-proof defendant]: when .red[Injurer]’s liability is limited by bankruptcy (i.e. can’t afford to pay the full cost of damages)
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/emptypockets.png)
]
]

---

# Judgment-Proof Defendants

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- We saw strict liability causes .red[Injurer] to fully internalize expected harm done, choose efficient precaution `\(x^\star\)`

- But what about the following example:
  - .red[Injurer] causes $1,000,000 worth of harm
  - .red[Injurer] only owns assets worth $100,000
  - Anticipating this, he knows `\(D&lt;A\)`...so he doesn’t internalize full cost of harm, takes less than efficient precaution `\((x&lt;x^\star)\)`

]
]

# Judgment-Proof Defendants: Businesses

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- What about businesses that are judgment-proof?

- Consider a hazardous waste disposal company
  - One that expects to be in business for a long time has incentives to be very careful, avoid accidents/liability and harm to its reputation (and costs to shareholders)
  - Vs. one that operates recklessly in the hopes of high short-term profit, pay out to shareholders, remain **undercapitalized** and anticipate going bankrupt after the first lawsuit
]
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/emptypockets.png)
]
]

---

# Judgment-Proof Defendants: Businesses
.pull-left[

.smallest[
- .hi-green[Example]: Suppose the hazardous waste disposal company transports waste, a spill of which would create $50,000,000 of harm

- Can upgrade their trucks for $225,000 to reduce likelihood of an accident from 1/100 to 1/500
  - MB: Reduces expected harm from $500,000 to $100,000
  - Efficient for them to do so

# Judgment-Proof Defendants: Businesses
.pull-left[

.smallest[
- If company forced to pay $50m in damages after accident under strict liability, would choose to upgrade their trucks

- But suppose the company is only worth $5,000,000
  - Now, if an accident, pay $5m and go out of business
  - Now the upgrade reduces expected damages from $50,000 to $10,000; not worth the cost!

- Thus, judgment-proof business takes less than efficient amount of caution

# Regulation

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- No perfect solution to these problems

- Whenever liability `\(&gt;\)` .red[injurer]’s wealth, liability alone does not create sufficient incentives for efficient precaution

- Regulations that mandate efficient levels of precaution can help mitigate this problem
  - Inspect and assess large fines to firms that do not meet the legal standard *before* any accident happens
  - Also works better than liability when accidents impose small harms on large group of people (nobody finds it worthwhile to sue)

# Insurance

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- We have assumed that either .red[Injurer] or .blue[Victim] bears the cost of the accident, depending on liability rule

- But when either (or both) parties have .hi[liability insurance], parties don’t bear full cost of accident! 
  - .hi[Moral hazard problem]: insured parties have weaker incentives to take precaution
  - The liability rule affects *the insurance companies* rather than drivers or pedestrians

]
]
.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/insurance2.jpg)
]
]

---

# Insurance

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- However, in real life, insurance tends to be incomplete, largely because insurance companies try to combat moral hazard:
  - Deductible, coinsurance, or copayment policy; might only cover tangible harms
  - Accident often causes insurance premiums to rise, so .red[injurer] not completely insulated from accident costs
  - Discounts for good behavior, Drivers' Education, etc.
  - Insurance company may impose safety standards required for policyholders to meet
      - Can make even insured injurers face liability for their negligence!

# Litigation Costs

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- So far, we’ve assumed litigation costs nothing

- If litigation is costly (and it is!), it affects incentives in opposing directions:

- If litigation is costly for .blue[Victims], they may bring fewer suits
  - Some accidents go “unpunished,” leading to less incentive for .red[Injurer] precaution

- If being sued is costly for .red[Injurers], they internalize more than the cost of the accident
  - Have more incentive for precaution

# Litigation Costs

.pull-left[

.quitesmall[
- Under strict liability, we saw .red[Injurers] fully internalize the cost of accident, leading to them choosing efficient precaution `\((x^\star)\)`
  - But this assumes cost of being sued = damage done
  - If courts are unpredictable, and litigation costly, private cost of being sued could `\(&gt;\)` or `\(&lt;\)` cost of accident
  - Leading to too much or too little precaution

- But if parties can’t settle out of court, and case goes to trial...
  - .hi-purple[Social cost of accident] includes both the harm done **and the resources spent on the trial**

# Litigation Costs

.pull-left[

# Who Pays the Litigation Costs?

.pull-left[

- In U.K., the loser often pays the legal fees of the winner, .hi[“The English Rule”]
  - Discourages nuisance suits
  - But also discourages suit where there was actual harm (but hard to prove)

- In U.S., each side generally pays their own legal costs, .hi[“The American Rule”]
  - Some States have laws that change this under certain circumstances

# Who Pays the Litigation Costs?

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- Rule 68 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:
]

.tiny[
&gt; “At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer [for a settlement]...
	If the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.”
	
]

.smallest[
- “Fee-shifting rule”

- .hi-green[Example]: I hit you with my car, you sue me.
  - Before trial, I offer to settle for $6,000, you refuse
  - You win at trial, but damages are only $5,000
  - Then you would have to pay all of my legal expenses after I made the offer 
]
]

.pull-right[

]
]

# Who Pays the Litigation Costs?

.pull-left[

- Rule 68 encourages settlements in two ways:
  1. Gives .red[Defendant] added incentive to **make a serious settlement offer**
  2. Gives .blue[Plaintiff] added incentive to **accept the offer**

- A one-sided rule
  - .blue[Plaintiff] is penalized for rejecting .red[Defendant]'s offer
  - .red[Defendant] is not penalized for rejecting an offer from .blue[Plaintiff]

# How to Reduce Litigation Costs

.pull-left[

- If all courts cared about was efficiency:

- At the start of every lawsuit, flip a coin
  - Heads: lawsuit proceeds, but damages are doubled
  - Tails: lawsuit immediately dismissed

- Expected damages remain the same, with same incentives for precaution
  - But half as many lawsuits to deal with!

# (Im)perfect Compensation

  - Returns .blue[victim] to pre-accident level of well-being
  - Works like insurance
  - Sets correct incentive for .red[Injurers]

&gt; “Recovery for wrongful death represents damages to the survivors for the loss of value of decedent’s life.  There is no special formula under the law to assess the plaintiff’s damages...

&gt; You must use your wisdom and judgment and your sense of basic justice to translate into dollars and cents the amount which will fully, fairly, and reasonably compensate the next of kin for the death of the decedent.

# (Im)perfect Compensation

.pull-left[

.quitesmall[
- Another odd feature of compensatory damages

- Most people would rather be horribly injured than killed
  - Means killing someone does more damage than injuring someone

- But compensatory damages tend to be **lower** for a fatal accident than accident where victim is injured but not killed
  - When someone is horribly injured, may require huge amount of money to compensate them
  - In wrongful-death case, damages compensate a victim’s loved ones, but **no attempt to compensate the victim** (who is deceased)
  - So damages tend to be smaller

&gt; “Although the tradeoff estimates vary considerably depending on the population exposed to the risk, the nature of the risk, individuals' income level, and similar factors, most of the reasonable estimates of the value of life are clustered in the $3 million-$7 million range...In practice, value-of-life debates seldom focus on whether the appropriate value of life should be $3 or $4 million...However, the estimates do provide guidance as to whether risk reduction efforts that cost $50,000 per life saved or $50 million per life saved are warrented. The threshold for the Office of Management and Budget to be successful in rejecting proposed risk regulations has been in excess of $100 million,” (pp.1942-1943).

&gt; The answer determines how much spending the government should require to prevent a single death.

# The McDonalds Coffee Case

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- Rule in place was **comparative negligence**
  - Jury found both parties negligent, McDonalds 80% responible
  - Calculated compensatory damages of $200,000 `\(\times\)` 80% `\(\implies\)` $160,000
  - Added $2.9 million punitive damages
  - Jury seemed to be using punitive damages to punish McDonalds for being arrogant and uncaring

- Judge reduced punitive damages to 3x compensatory, so total of $640,000

- During appeal, parties settled out of court for some smaller amount

- .hi-green[Example]: Suppose a .red[manufacturer] can take precaution to eliminate 10 accidents a year, each causing $1,000 in damages, for a cost of $7,000
  - Clearly efficient, a $10,000 reduction in expected liability for $7,000
  - If every .blue[victim] sued and won, .red[manufacturer] has incentive to take this precaution
  - But suppose many do not, suppose only half the .blue[victims] will bring successful lawsuits
  - Compensatory damages total $5,000 — .red[manufacturer] is better off paying the damages instead of the (efficient) precaution
  - A solution: award **higher damages** to the cases that *are* brought

# The Economic Purpose of Punitive Damages

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Punitive damages should be related to compensatory damages, but higher the more likely .red[Injurer] is to “get away with it”
  - .hi-green[Example]: if 50% of accidents lead to successful lawsuits, then total damages should be 2x harm, so punitive damages = compensatory damages
  - if 10% of accidents lead to awards, total damages should be 10x harm, so punitive damages = 9x compensatory damages

- Seems most appropriate when .red[injurer]'s actions were deliberately fraudulent, may have been based on cost-benefit analysis of chance of being caught
  - Better internalizes the expected cost of .red[Injurer]'s actions

# The Economic Purpose of Punitive Damages

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Historically, punitive damages paid to .blue[victim]
  - Seems arbitrary, .blue[victim] is already being fully compensated
  - Creates much greater incentive to sue, accidents become jackpots

- Some States now have laws that a share of punitive damages go to the State
  - Creates own issue: State now has vested interest in seeing .blue[Plaintiffs] being awarded punitive damages!

- In terms of setting .red[injurer]'s incentives (or punishing after the fact), doesn't really matter where money goes
  - Setting it on fire would achieve same purpose (but be less efficient)

# Tort Liability vs. Regulation: “The Rise of the Regulatory State”

---

# The Rise of the Regulatory State

&gt; “Before 1900, significant commercial disputes in the United States were generally resolved through private litigation”

- This changed dramatically between 1887—1917 “Progressive Era”

&gt; “Reformers eroded the nineteenth-century belief that private litigation was the sole appropriate response to social wrongs.”
“...Regulatory agencies at both the state and the federal level took over the social control of competition, anti-trust policy, railroad pricing, food and drug safety, and many other areas.”

- Why?

---

# The Rise of the Regulatory State

&gt; “By the late nineteenth century, the development of tort law was greatly accelerated by the industrial revolution, especially the railroads.”

&gt; “Trains were also wild beasts; they roared through the countryside, killing livestock, setting fires on houses and crops, smashing wagons at gate crossings, mangling passengers and freight.  Boilers exploded; trains hurtled off tracks; bridges collapsed; locomotives collided in a grinding scream of steel.  Railroad law and tort law grew up, then, together.”  (Lawrence Freidman)

- Very little regulation – instead, private litigation (victims bringing lawsuits)

---

# The Rise of the Regulatory State

&gt; “Duane Lockard and Walter Murphy (1992) claim that judges supported corporations because of “a campaign to ‘educate’ judges about the sacredness of private property.”

&gt; “The thrust of the rules, taken as a whole, approached the position that corporate enterprise should be flatly immune from actions for personal injury” (Friedman)

&gt; “In addition to influencing the selection of judges and prosecutors, nineteenth-century corporations projected substantial political influence, superior lawyers, and ready access to large legal war chests.  Their lawyers produced briefs that exonerated their clients and slowed down the wheels of justice for years.”

&gt; Also corruption: “intimidation and bribery of witnesses, payments and political pressures on judges and legislators, and theft and destruction of evidence…”

---

# Political Pressure to Do Something

.pull-left[

- Many States and Federal government started passing regulatory laws that created regulatory agencies
  - Pure Food and Drug Act (1906)
  - Federal Reserve Act (1913)
  - Federal Trade Commission Act (1916)

- Over time, negligence (hard to prove) replaced with strict liability combined with regulation

# Corruptibility of Institutions

.pull-left[

- So far, we’ve assumed our institutions are not .hi[corruptible]

- .red[Injurer] who is legally liable will be found liable in court and ordered to pay damages

- Legislatures (elected by voters) and judges try to shape law towards efficient outcomes

# Aside: Helland and Tabarrok on Electoral Institutions

- In many U.S. States, state judges **campaign for office** and are **elected**

.quitesmall[
&gt; “Politicians are not neutral maximizers of the public good; they respond to incentives, just like other individuals. A clear understanding of political behavior requires, therefore, an understanding of incentive structures. Yet with few exceptions this insight has not been applied to those politicians. we call judges. The lack of attention is surprising, since judicial incentive structures differ widely in the United States and thus provide an ideal testing ground for economic theories of politics. One important division occurs across the states. State court judges are elected in 23 states and are appointed in 27. Of the 23 elected states, ten use highly competitive parti- san elections, whereas in the remainder judges run on nonpartisan ballots. A second division occurs between federal and state judges. Federal judges are appointed and have life tenure, whereas, as just noted, many state court judges are elected and, with the exception of superior court judges in Rhode Island, none have life tenure. We argue that in cases involving corporate defendants with out-of-state headquarters, elected judges, particularly partisan elected judges, have an incentive to grant larger awards than other judges.” (pp.341-342)

# Aside: Helland and Tabarrok on Electoral Institutions

.quitesmall[
&gt; “Partisan elected judges must cater to their constituents, and they must raise campaign funds in order to be elected. We hypothesized that these forces would increase awards in partisan elected states relative to other states, particularly awards against out-of-state businesses. The evidence, both from the cross-state regressions and from diversity of citizenship cases, strongly supports the partisan election hypothesis. .hi[In cases involving out-of-state defendants and in-state plaintiffs, the average award (conditional on winning) is $362,988 higher in partisan than in nonpartisan states; $230,092 of the larger award is due to a bias against out-of-state defendants, and the remainder is due to generally higher awards against businesses in partisan states.]

# Liability System is Also Corruptible!

.smaller[
- Suppose there is some cost `\(X\)` to subvert any legal institution
  - Cost of bribing judges, intimidating witnesses, electing favorable legislators, etc.

- If I owe `\(Y\)` in damages under a (tort) liability system
  - If `\(Y &lt; X\)`: I'll pay damages
  - If `\(Y &gt; X\)`: I'll subvert the system

- If I owe `\(Y\)` in fines under a regulatory system
  - If `\(Y &lt; X\)`: I'll pay fines
  - If `\(Y &gt; X\)`: I'll subvert the system

- But, regulation relies on smaller fines, tort liability relies on large but low-probability damage awards
