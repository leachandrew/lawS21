- Keeps intuitive appeal of Pareto but more practical
    - Every Pareto improvement is a KH-improvement (but not the other way around!)

- Policies should **maximize social value of resources**

# Welfare Economics
.smallest[

  - initial endowments does not affect efficiency but does affect final distribution

  - allows a targetted (re)-distribution to be achieved without sacrificing efficiency

# Welfare Economics

- Incentive to **overexploit** and **deplete** resource (before others do)

- In a .hi[competitive market] in .hi[long run equilibrium]:
  - .hi-purple[Economic profit] is driven to $0; resources (factors of production) optimally allocated
  - .hi-purple[Allocatively efficient]: `\(p=MC(q)\)`, maximized .blue[CS] `\(+\)` .red[PS]
  - .hi-purple[Productively efficient]: `\(p=AC(q)_{min}\)` (otherwise firms would enter/exit)

.pull-right[

- Consider a market with some simplified cost assumptions:
  - No fixed costs, constant variable costs
  - implies `\(\color{red}{MC(q)=AC(q)}\)`

- If this was a *competitive* market, firms would set `\(p_c=MC(q)\)` and (collectively), industry would produce `\(q_c\)`
  - .blue[Consumer surplus] maximized

.pull-right[

- A **monopolist** faces the *entire* market demand and sets `\((q_m,p_m)\)`:
  - Sets .purple[`\\(MR(q)\\)`] `\(=\)` .red[`\\(MC(q)\\)`] at `\(q_m\)`
  - Raises price to .blue[maximum consumers are WTP (Demand)]: `\(p_m\)`

- .hi-purple[Restricts output and raises price], compared to competitive market

- Earns .hi-green[monopoly profits (`\\(p&gt;AC\\)`)] 

- Loss of .hi-blue[consumer surplus]

.pull-right[

- **Deadweight loss** of surplus destroyed from lost gains from trade
  - Consumers willing to buy more than `\(q_m\)`, if the monopolist would lower prices!
  - Monopolist *would* benefit by accepting lower prices to sell more, but this would yield *less* than maximum profits
