# What Is This Class About?

.pull-left[

- This is not a class ‚Äúabout‚Äù the law (or a law class)

- I am not a lawyer...though I am happily married to one

- This is a class about how to *think* about the law, using economics
  - Economics is a set of tools, not a bunch of facts or topics

- Using microeconomic tools to analyze laws and legal systems:
  - the incentives they create
  - the choices and outcomes they lead to

> ‚ÄúYou live in a state where the most severe criminal punishment is life imprisonment. Someone proposes that since armed robbery is a very serious crime, armed robbers should get a life sentence. A constitutional lawyer asks whether that is consistent with the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A legal philosopher asks whether it is just.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúAn economist points out that if the punishments for armed robbery and for armed robbery plus murder are the same, the additional punishment for the murder is zero‚Äîand asks whether you really want to make it in the interest of robbers to murder their victims.‚Äù (p.8)

# Thinking Like a Lawyer vs. Thinking Like an Economist

- Suppose something has happened

- Lawyer ‚Äî damage is *already* done, what to do:
  - assign blame
  - maybe punish someone
  - maybe compensate

- Not interesting to economists!

---

# Thinking Like a Lawyer vs. Thinking Like an Economist

- **Before** the incident, lots of **decisions** were made

- These were made based on **expectations** about what will happen

- These decisions affect the **outcomes** and **how much value is created and destroyed** by society

# The Law & Economics of 19th Century Whaling

- A burning legal question: **who owns a dead whale**?

- 18<sup>th</sup>‚Äî19<sup>th</sup> Century: whales hunted for oil, blubber, bone, other valuable products

- A whale could be worth 3-4 times the median family income

> [Or] after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm;	

> and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line.

- Looks at 12 U.S. & U.K. cases where ownership of a dead whale was contested

- Whaling industry had established norms in each case
  - Very different case by case, but well-suited to each situation

- In every case, court ruled in accordance with the established norms

- One norm: ‚Äúfast fish/loose fish‚Äù
  - Discussed in *Moby Dick*

- British whalers in Greenland hunting *right whales* with harpoons roped to whaling boat

- ‚ÄúFast fish‚Äù: a harpooned whale attached to boat
  - belonged to attached boat

- ‚Äúloose fish‚Äù: whale that broke free, or had not been harpooned
  - other ships free to pursue it

- *Sperm whales* swim faster, deeper, and fight harder, and travel in packs
  - hunt with ‚Äúdrogues‚Äù to tire out whale
  - most important to kill or wound as many whales as possible quickly rather than secure one at a time

- Another norm: ‚Äúiron holds the whale‚Äù
  - first to harpoon the whale owns it, so long as your are in ‚Äúfresh pursuit‚Äù

# Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will: 

1. Grapple with the conflicting social goals of justice and efficiency

3. Apply economic models to determine the efficiency of legal rules

4. Identify the sources of law in the United States: common law jurisprudence, legislative statutes, administrative law

5. Identify the key legal institutions of the United States: state vs. federal courts, the appellate court system, state and federal constitutions, regulatory agencies, arbitration
