- .hi-turquoise[Before] the incident, lots of .hi-turquoise[decisions] were made, e.g.
  - how much to invest in precaution (how fast to drive, wearing a helmet while biking, etc)
  - reaching a contractual agreement
  - transforming my property (planting trees that block my neighbor's view)
  - relying on my supplier to deliver on time

- These were made based on .hi-turquoise[expectations] about what will happen

- More importantly, .hi[how do laws and court decisions affect *future* behavior on the margin?]
  - switch the U.S. from a "first to discover" to a "first to file" patent system
  - change mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related crimes

- Economists are more *forward*-looking about law

# Three Projects in Law & Economics

.pull-left[

1. Predicting consequences of law
  - least controversial

2. Predicting what law will be
  - an empirical conjecture: law *is* efficient

3. Recommending what law should be
  - a normative project: law *should* be efficient

- You could still believe:
  - law is efficient, but should not be
  - law is not efficient, but should be

# Outline and Areas of Law

.pull-left[

1. Property Law
  - how do we establish who is entitled to what?
2. Contract Law
  - how do individuals permit use or exchange of entitlements?
3. Tort Law
  - how do we remedy violations of persons or entitlements?
4. Criminal Law
  - how does *the State* remedy *egregious* harms to *society*?

- You will see the same economic analysis showing up...if you understand one area of law, you can easily understand the others!

# Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will: 

1. Predict the consequences of various laws, institutions, and customs
2. Predict what law will emerge under given conditions
3. Determine whether law *is* economically efficient, and discuss whether the law *should* be economically efficient
4. Derive the economic functions of key concepts, legal maxims, and rules in the substantive areas of law: torts, property, contracts, and criminal law
5. Identify the sources of law in the United States
6. Identify the key legal institutions of the United States
