# Determining Guilt or Innocence

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- We spent most of our focus in criminal law (and in all of our areas of law) on **how law affects incentives**
  - i.e. deter crime; reduce accidents; encourage trade

- We have not spent any time on **how the legal process determines guilt or innocence**
  - We don’t have time to build a detailed theory
  - So instead, here are two of my favorite papers on the subject

If his arm was unharmed, he was exonerated. If not, he was convicted. Alternatively, a priest dunked the defendant in a pool. Sinking proved his innocence; floating proved his guilt. People called these trials ordeals. No one alive today believes ordeals were a good way to decide defendants’ guilt.

# Trial By Battle

.pull-left[

- Norman conquest of England (1066) introduced trial by battle (*duellum*)

- Until 1179, it was England’s *primary* judicial procedure for deciding land ownership disputes

- Most dismiss it as being barbaric, irrational, ineffective solution to disputes

I argue that  judicial combat  was sensible and effective. In a feudal world where high transaction costs confounded the Coase theorem, trial by battle allocated disputed property rights efficiently,” (342).

- Court required evidence, such as witness testimony, to settle claims
  - Also acted as screening device to reduce frivolous cases
  - But, often no evidence existed, and no objective way to determine the land’s “true” owner
  - Used trial by combat to determine the owner
    - Again, official belief was God would favor the true owner and abandon the fraud

# Trial By Battle: Why They Were Necessary

- Under feudalism, property rights (in land) were **extremely sticky**
  - Land is inherited by eldest son, or reallocated by authority of the crown
  - All users of land (all the way down to tenants) had veto rights over changes in land use
  - Not even the beginnings of a market for land until at least 13th century

- Prohibitively high transaction costs for land ownership

# Trials as Auctions

- For efficiency, property rights should flow to their highest valued users

- Coase Theorem: if transaction costs are low, this is exactly what will happen, so long as rights are clearly defined and tradeable

- All types of auction tend to allocate resources efficiently — to higher bidding party
  - But auctions come with social costs
  
- Problem 1: might be differences in endowments (wealth) that affect WTP; can mitigate with credit markets (but poor access to credit in 10th century England!)

- Problem 2: bids are a transfer to the party or institution holding the auction, which creates incentives for rent-seeking
  - Create bogus disputes just to extract wealth, which weakens property rights

> “Illegitimate land disputes, which result from bid recipients’ attempts to raise their  incomes instead of from genuinely felt ownership disagreements, undermine property rights. They constitute socially costly rent-seeking activity rather than socially productive ownership resolution. Individuals who confront the specter of rampant rent seeking are insecure in their property rights. They live in constant fear that fraudulent legal challengers will deprive them of their property. Therefore they have weak incentives to invest in their land,” (p.342).

Expecting the higher-valuing  disputant to outbid him, the lower-valuing disputant is therefore encouraged to bid less. That, in turn, allows the higher-valuing disputant to bid less too. In contrast, in a regular auction only the higher bidder pays his bid. The lower-valuing user therefore has no incentive to bid anything lower than his full valuation of the disputed right...As  a result, disputants spend more to affect the allocation of disputed property rights in a regular auction than they do in trial by battle’s violent one.

> Second, unlike in a regular auction, in trial by battle’s violent auction the higher-biddingdisputant only wins the auction probabilistically. The higher-spending  disputant who sends a better champion to the arena is more likely to win the disputed  right, but it’s possible for the lower-spending disputant’s inferior champion to upset him. In contrast, in a regular auction the  higher-bidding disputant always wins the  auction. The “randomness” in trial by battle’s violent auction, which doesn’t exist in a  regular auction, reduces the value of making higher bids. That, in turn, encourages disputants to bid less. The result again is that disputants spend more to affect the allocation of disputed property rights in a regular auction than they do in trial by battle’s violent one,” (p.360).

> “Once each disputant knows who their adversary has hired, and thus has a good idea about what he spent on the trial, battle is unnecessary. At this point both parties know the  trial’s probabilistic outcome. They can save time and expense by settling their dispute instead. Thus my theory predicts that disputants should’ve settled most trials by battle. In fact it predicts that disputants should’ve always settled unless they had sufficiently different assessments of their champions’ comparative skill, or bargaining itself proved too costly and thus broke down...As long as the victorious champion’s identity isn’t a fore-gone conclusion, a mutually beneficial bargaining range that permits settlement exists. Disputants have an incentive to settle until battle is over,” (p.363).

- Trials by battle were a mechanism meant to .hi-purple[induce settlement] between the parties, so long as it was unclear who would win

- Courts took pains to minimize the social cost of the trials
  - Combatants mandated to use non-lethal weapons (clubs, *baculi cornuti* and shields), and use protective gear; very rare a combatant was killed (only 1 documented case)
  - Turned into public spectator sport; popular, well-attended (also increases the public finality of the title!)

> “When the transaction cost of trading land is low, and thus property rights in land are fluid, things are different. In this case society can rely on the Coase theorem to reallocate land to higher-valuing users if judges’ initial allocation of contested property is wrong. Trial by battle’s demand-revelation and allocation  mechanism  is  unnecessary. It imposes a cost without a corresponding benefit. Trial by battle is inefficient. Thus my theory predicts that England’s legal system should’ve abandoned trial by battle for deciding land disputes when the transaction cost of trading land  fell significantly. The history of trial by battle’s decline in English land disputes supportsthis prediction. In the second half of the twelfth century Henry II introduced important legal changes in England—the so-called Angevin reforms. These changes mark the birth of English common law and the beginning of feudalism’s end in England...In this  period traditional feudal property arrangements declined significantly. With them, so did the transaction cost of trading land,” (p.366—367).

  - How people respond to incentives, the consequences of any particular rule
  - Which rules would lead to efficient behavior
  - And whether we should want to attain that

2) Efficiency as a goal is a good starting point
  - Not the *only* goal for society, but maximizing total wealth is a good thing
  - Can always *redistribute* resources (via government) afterwards
  - Forces us to be honest about other political goals

3) Coase Theorem: can we depend on people to bargain to efficient outcomes?
  - Yes, if transaction costs are low — design law to keep them low
  - No, if transaction costs are high — design law to get the initial allocation correct
      - Private necessity, duress, eminent domain

4) Efficiency requires incentives to engage in socially productive activities...but in excess can cause rent-seeking
  - Nuisance law, contract law, tort law help people internalize externalities they cause
  - Allowing people to profit from (productive, but not redistributive) information and ownership (but avoid excessive quarrels over first possession)

5) A perfect rule may not exist, even in theory...
  - Paradox of compensation: single rule sets multiple parties’ incentives
  - Expectation damages for contract breach can’t get both efficient breach and efficient reliance
  - Tort liability can’t get efficient activity level for injurers and victims

6) ...and even if it does, it might not be what we want in practice
  - Administrative costs vs. error costs
  - Whaling: fast fish/loose fish vs. iron-holds-the-whale; Fox case: initial pursuer vs. final claimaint owning
  - Demsetz: cost vs. benefits of property rights vs. commons
  - Criminal law: deterrence is costly, but reduces crimes

7) Understand how our conclusions depend on our assumptions
  - Rationality
  - Perfect compensation
  - Incorruptibility
  - The world is a complicated place! How robust are our institutions to these real world problems?
